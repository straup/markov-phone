Some short thoughts
It is quicker and easier for computers to guess what you can remember than it is for you to come up with something memorable and difficult to guess which is just another way of computers trying to make us bags of meat feel inadequate:
Kepler is hockey-sticking its planet-finding capability which is such a wonderfully optimistic sentence I never could hope to type but one that simultaneously makes me sad about what I feel is feasible within my lifetime
But perhaps not my son's
Also holy shit Washington Post URLs
Ars Technica takes a look at moving image representation of messaging but doesn't include nearly enough screenshots in my opinion
Remember when Will Smith was all I don't trust robots because some robot saved his life instead of the other person and he was all guilty about it and needed therapy but phew he had Converse boots and an Audi?
Speaking of Will Smith so I have this thing where I want to throw a film festival and the theme would be Haxploitation and we would show things like Hackers obviously and Swordfish and Sneakers Sneakers is such a good movie I spent at least six months of my teenage years wanting to grow up to be Robert Redford for entirely different reasons than most other people who wanted to grow up to be Robert Redford but also Firewall and Stealth and The Net and AntiTrust and I Robot and maybe TV shows like Killer Net and Attachments my British sensibility showing through or even that stupendous supercut of the Mainframe or even just watching episodes of NCIS
When I raved a few episodes back about the potential of the Marvel Universe API Kim Plowright rightly wrote back and pointed out the other side of the double-edged API sword
That entire fictional universes under the control of an API with binary decisions albeit enforcing human will could well be a severe stunt to the creativity of fandom
The geek desire to catalogue and mechanise my necessity organises categorises and sets up barriers
At the BBC Plowright along with others spent an inordinate amount of time trying to create the one true datamodel that would handle comedy and drama storytelling: because well part of the beauty of the BBC is that it's able to think about things in such a large systemic way
It is of course that very British institution
With hindsight systematizing and coming up with a framework to describe All Storytelling might seem a little like a fool's errand: before you know it you're knee deep in ontologies and RDF and if you're unlucky someone might even have crowbarred some XML in there if only because it was a buzzword that helped the project retain momentum
This being the BBC though where the design of any sufficiently large system is was? the driving goal of the place you end up trying to produce a framework that can satisfy the edgiest of edge cases and that means something like a multi-decade running storyline like Doctor Who or EastEnders the latter of which might be defensible but the former of which involves Time Travel for crying out loud and a singular consciousness inhabiting multiple physical instantiations
It's almost as if the series creators were trolling the requirements capturing process
The wonderful wonderful point and parallel that Plowright made in a series of emails to me is what fandom needs to do what it does
It needs dense text as source material but it also needs an intimate knowledge of that test
It also needs some sort of innate instinctual understanding of the interconnectedness of all things in terms of that text how each piece relates to each other piece and in context with all the other pieces
That's an incredibly amount of data unstructured data at that
And that's not what an ontological organising system like RDF is good at really
It's not a coincidence that at exactly the time this research was going on at the BBC a number of other ex-BBC ejecta were busy inventing folksonomies with the introduction of tagging over at Flickr and the whole idea of bottom-up organisation
And at the same time what do we see with things like Pinboard and Delicious and their adoption by the fandom and slash-writing community? Exactly
This is where I drop in to Mike Rugnetta's talk from 013's XOXO because he explains so eloquently what it is for fandom to be fandom and what it is for fandom to create
The creative tension is in the looseness that can still be preserved against the power unlocked by a queryable API that makes reaching for that information about a story universe so much easier than having it all in your brain
Plowright's last point also sticks with me: that this post-event construction of a storyline ie that the linear narrative that emerges when you gasp for air coming up from an extended tvtropes dive - is rather like the way your brain constructs narrative out of the frankly disjointed yet occasionally awesome fragments you see whilst dreaming
Or even: isn't this what we're being told consciousness is? A post-hoc rationalisation of a bewildering barrage of sensory data comingled with unbidden retrieval of memory and sense and only then only afterwards do we find a way to describe to us what we've just experienced
So here's the thing
Mobile computing is capital D disrupting everything and our VCs are running around like the world is literally on Fire
Marc Andreessen is Tweeting for Christ's sake so something serious must be going on
One of the favourite stories that I like to tell is about Tetris Angry Birds Game Boys and iPhones
I say: there was a time when Tetris could've been on the front cover of every magazine in the world the latest fad that had caught the attention of children everywhere
Most people nod their heads at this point: yes I can see that as a thing that could've happened
But Tetris was only so big right? Because the people playing Tetris needed to have portable video games consoles
But this thing here - an iPhone specifically - is an Adult Device it's an important thing that I use to make phone calls and do business business business numbers
It just happens that it's accidentally also powerful enough to be a games console I mean Angry Bird playing device
And so Moore's law inexorably drove down the cost of computing and made it more available so that eventually everything could read email and play Tetris
And the stigma such that culture afforded it attached to videogames vanished a bit because it could be hidden behind a veil of adult productivity
Computing at some point became this thing that was wrenched from the hands of women -- computers -- and thrust into the well thrusting hands of men
Realise that this is generalisation of course but manly productive things are done with computers - like business business business numbers sorry I mean Word Excel PowerPoint - and Microsoft's ambition to put a computer on every Desk
The liberation of computing by the inexorable application of Moore's law in the efficiency direction not in the hot and fast desktop direction has meant that as a direct result of needing to find more things to put processors in or more charitably the things for which it is now trivial and pennies on the dollar to put processors in by definition the audience for things that can process things has expanded beyond People Who Wear Shirts And Sit At Desks
The wonderful thing about this is that it's going to happen anyway
Moore's law doesn't really care
The Bay Area doesn't even have to notice
I mean it'd be nice if it happened faster
But I think it's going to happen anyway
That's the optimistic version of me
What's going to happen? Things like this: the Bay Area only sees the top of the ice berg
The bay area gets excited about a trend like wearables and quantified selves and is good at seeing things that it thinks it can sell to closely-aligned versions of itself
The smartest thing a company like Apple ever did was to decide to make things for 'the rest of us' and for Jobs to be such an outsider
So with something like quantified self the Bay Area can get excited about charts and dashboards and graphs and tracking and journalling whilst completely forgetting that Weight Watchers has been doing quite well at this tracking and measuring lark and that hey maybe scrapbooking is totally a thing and do you remember Zazzle because they're totally still around
The rest of the ice berg is everyone else
There are clearly structural barriers to a more equitable gender balance in the field of making apps but the confluence of factors such as relatively easy digital distribution as well as pretty much approaching the point of free Android smartphone with your cereal mean that the chances of something for the rest of the iceberg being designed developed and deployed are so much higher than they ever were before
So that's the real revolution
I feel like it'll happen anyway
And yes it should happen or have happened sooner and the fact that it's going to happen anyway shouldn't preclude efforts to accelerate it
But
I am looking forward to the Bay Area and the traditional White Male Scratch Your Own Privileged Itch model to have to compete with a wonderful diversity of ideas that can't be held back
Look if you haven't seen The Lego Movie at least once by now you're just going to be left behind
Abraham Loeb's paper got published over a month ago on arxiv which from what I can make out is where scientists go to publish their reckons before they get run through some sort of peer-review validation system where they can be published alongside markov-generated non-science but I digress
This week the Kepler mission team at NASA announced that with a new crop of 15 discovered planets we'd practically doubled the haul of planets we know about in the universe
This is really exciting
I mean really really exciting: to actually know that there are other planets out there; I don't know
You should be shitting yourself with excitement
It shouldn't make you feel small
It should make you feel amazed to be part of something so wonderfully complex that we're just scratching the surface of its understanding
Of those 15 discovered planets four are in the habitable zone of their system's star
The habitable zone is also called the Goldilocks zone because it's not too hot not too cold and is just right in terms of its planet surface temperature to allow for the existence of liquid water one of the things in our admittedly limited knowledge that allows life to take place
All the life that we know about requires liquid water as a solvent - and while we can imagine different types of life supported by different solvents like ammonia or methane-based life we obviously haven't discovered those yet
That's why we get inordinately excited about planets which are in a star's goldilocks zone
They're the closet we've gotten to even the most tantalising evidence that we might not be alone and that life on Earth isn't a fluke
But what if there were another way of thinking about the goldilocks zone? What if there were other habitable zones?
That's what Abraham Loeb figured out in such a stupendously smart inverted way of looking at the problem of finding habitable zones
See we were preoccupied with finding habitable zones as a function of physical space
A habitable zone we thought was a narrow strip a spherical envelope around a heat source capable of sustaining the only life we know about
Abraham Loeb didn't look for a habitable zone in any of the physical dimensions
He looked in the temporal one
See one of the most amazing things about science and how it works is its power for prediction
This is a digression but an important one I feel
We had a theory about the big bang: that the universe originated at a single point and inflated everywhere at the same time
If it did that then it meant that everywhere would've been the same temperature at the same time
That was the theory
When the Cosmic Microwave Background Explorer COBE mission flew it would observe the cosmic microwave background radiation - essentially the heat and echo left over from the birth of our universe
And it turned out that the data from COBE fit the theory perfectly
Absolutely god-damned perfectly
Science
It works bitches
Our universe started small and hot
Like really really hot
And it inflated and cooled down
Abraham Loeb realised that there would've been a point - in his paper he refers to it as a red-shift of 00<1+z<137 - which essentially means around 10-17 million years after the Big Bang - when the temperature of the universe would've cooled to somewhere between zero and a hundred degrees celsius
In other words the temperature range that allows for liquid water
In other words the goldilocks zone
In other words: the entire universe was a goldilocks zone
Small rocky planets if they existed and there are theories that they could have could then have had liquid water on their surface
If there were a perfect moment for life - at least as we know it - to have existed it would have been at that time
The entire universe would have been habitable
A giant all-encompassing soup of gassy habitableness
I love this on so many levels
At least a few are just because of what feels like the poetry of the science involved
But really it's because Loeb made such a stupendous orthogonal intuitive leap
The whole premise of looking for a habitable zone necessarily precluded considering the entire universe as such a zone
The search parameters for the zone and its definition require a star as a heat source and then that one act - well we know of a time when the entire universe was hot - of removing that requirement of a star as a heat source and instead trying to find it elsewhere
It's amazing
Literally inspiring of awe
Yesterday I wrote about the concept of a Very British Startup and in that wonderful sense of synchronicity where people smarter than you do things more eloquently than you with words and stuff Cameron Koczon published a great article on The Pastry Box project titled Scenes from the Internet
It was a lament at the shutting down of Editorially and a recognition of the refreshingly honest post about why: Editorially has failed to attract enough users to be sustainable and we cannot honestly say we have reason to expect that to change
Koczon goes on to dissect the narrative behind WhatsApp and patiently explains the job that it is that VCs do
I've been on the end of this twice; at the first startup I joined Mind Candy before it executed its last-minute saving-throw pivot from in my view stupendously early monetised collectible card game/ARG to stupendously successful kids virtual world; and latterly when my brother and I moved on and took angel funding from a pseudo-government VC
Koczon tries to put it in simple terms
VCs are in the explicit business of betting on huge returns
Huge
It's not for nothing that there's talk of hockeysticks in growth terms
And let me put it to you like this if you haven't been there: do you know what it feels like to be on the ascent of a hockey stick? I don't
I only know what it was like to be aggressively pushed and maneuvered onto the launchpad and to be doused in the accelerant
The goal of the VC is that amongst its portfolio of companies there are the one or two that will provide the hundred-x return that will satisfy their fund partners growth rates
Whatever it takes
VCs as such aren't villains as Koczon points out
They're simply aggressive monomaniacal dollar-sign copy-pasting machines
You have to hand it to them they're pretty direct about what they want
Now if you know that's what you're getting into that's absolutely fine
But and this is a big but that's demonstrably not the only way to a run a business or b solve a problem
Sometimes priorities and agendas might line up just so where a VC and a founding team love each other very much and everyone gets what everyone gets
But by definition those goals are pretty lofty
I don't know if it's just a British/American culture thing but there's a likely rose-tinted hobbyist Isambard Kingdom Brunel type of lack of missionary zeal
In my head I have alarm bells going off and lights flashing when I try to describe him or the thought of him as someone who would roll up his sleeves muck in and get the job done as being distinctly Cameron-esque
But fuck me if there wasn't a considered carefulness to everything that he did but at the same time an undeniable big-world effect
And all without again that missionary zeal of hockey sticking profit motive and talk of markets
If you're ever considering dealing with a VC and you have't before just remember this quote from The Bourne Identity: Look at what they make you give
Now I'm personally attached to the story and journey of BERG because many of the people who work and have worked there are close friends
But they are by no means the only example of that very particular British endeavour and isn't there something interesting in characterising a business as an endeavour rather than a startup? The force of American narrative around business is so strong that even the Lean Manifesto camp cannot help but be evangelistic about their way of doing things
But what is a quiet way of doing things? Of tinkering around at the edges and not of making the world change through fury and light but through strategic applications of force? It's this way and arguably - and probably a post-rationalisation that you could explain the success of ARM Holdings that finally won the great RISC/CISC war and in the end may well be the microprocessor architecture that holds sway for the next fifty years as everything irrevocably heads towards being capable of computation
A British company? How strange
I'm reminded of Stephenson's clades from The Diamond Age - in that particular case he was making the point of cultural affiliation being stronger than national - and we don't need to look much further than our 1cen newsnets to see how the cryptocurrency movement or occupy or open source is reflecting that point for him
But again Stephenson grafted onto that the Vickys and a certain fetishisation of their strict moral code
I do wonder if the BERG-alikes are eking out their own post-colonial humble British version of remaking the world
Only from a tinkerer's shed
My Twitter feed blew up this morning in response to Rachel Coldicutt's bloody insightful post in response to BERG's Cloudwash proof-of-concept
Entitled Domestic Folklore or Washing Machines for Men it was so much more helpful to the conversation about what's interesting about washing machine design than say a Medium article about how this one chap needs to call up his mum to decipher fabric care instructions
And yet
There's a stunning point right at the end of Coldicutt's second para where she insightfully cuts to the chase
Whether it's intended or not the Cloudwash proof-of-concept feels like a washing machine for men because the demo outlines scenarios that point to this:
It’s a washing machine for people who don’t know how to use washing machines; who don’t need to wash a wide-range of fabrics worry about how colourfast material is or how wet or dry clothes are when you take them out of the machine
It’s a washing machine for people who do bulk washes of jeans and t-shirts and sometimes wash other things
It does not through sexist intent I'm absolutely sure feel like a washing machine for people who do bulk washes of jeans and t-shirts - and yes sometimes other things - which generally and without wishing to stereotype feels like a washing machine for men
On the other hand it might not - again not wishing to stereotype - not feel like a washing machine for men to men
There are a number of things that ended up being explored in conversation on Twitter
Chief of which the disarmingly simple insight by Tom Insam that the problem such as it is isn't necessarily the washing of clothes
Washing is simply the activity
It's as he points out the care of the clothes
Chucking in any set of clothes at 0 degrees on a normal cycle is more or less going to get the clean
But for long-term care and making sure that things don't change size or bleed or bobble or whatever - that's why there are different programs and even why there's nothing preventing you from washing jeans and t-shirts together to get them clean if you want them to last longer you ideally shouldn't
It's interesting because the simple act of picking an object of which the design can be improved has unpacked and illustrated a vast array of issues
None of them are irrelevant but at the same time and this is a theme here they're all interconnected and depend upon context and nuance
It's a cop out to say it depends but it turns out that the simple act of washing clothes brings with it a lot of assumptions
Yes you can look at specialist domain knowledge being rendered obsolete as orthogonal to being a gender issue
It applies equally to men and women
To be fair given the state of the world that we live in right now practically everything has and probably should have an awareness of gender if only to deal with the fact that it hasn't purely out of habit
At the same time every item of clothing these days comes with detailed care instructions
It certainly isn't outside the capability of man to decide to take the time to look at those instructions and follow them or even to read a manual and yes this does open up the washing manufacturers to better designed machines that make it easier to match care instructions to their interfaces
Coldicutt says of this: Like it or not there’s a Secret Language of Domesticity
In technology terms it’s the equivalent of “viewing source”: it’s not intentionally secret it’s just easy to ignore if you’re not interested or don’t understand it
Now to put this another way would be to say that there's a certain amount of Domestic Infrastructure that like all infrastructure is hidden from plain sight
Or if you want to think about it differently is easy to ignore when you want to concentrate on its effects
It's this view-source of domestic infrastructure or another way of looking at it which reveals the underlying complexity
The care of clothes is not simply bung them all in the washing machine and select a program
It is naturally more nuanced than that
There are reasons why one might care more about one particular thing over another in a particular domestic situation I have to admit that for example in terms of domestic infrastructure I'm more interested in and more motivated to care about wifi signal strength and whether we have adequate coverage and do I need to check out the new Airport base stations and that's absolutely fine
What I guess I'm saying is this: increased visibility to complexity is a good thing in general
You might not want to deal with it afterwards but it's better to understand
Increased visibility into a task or practice or system that has historically reinforced a particular display of gender roles? Even better
The more I think about it the more complexity is hidden in a system and only its effects exposed I just put dirty clothes in the basket and then they reappear clean folded and put away the more it's likely to feel like magic and be disempowering
Ultimately though like with all magic it's not magic at all
It's just hard work and practice
I was chatting the other day on the phone with Yoz Grahame an old friend best described recursively - like a small yoz-shaped object
He had mentioned that his child's school required a printed not handwritten record of vaccinations as the latter was 'too easy to forge'
In a roundabout way we got onto the subject of government provision of services online - at one level that a friend of a friend had been involved in the Healthcare
gov Bay Area task force to try and untangle the godawful mess and that it was much much worse than you could possibly imagine think: dust off nuke the site from orbit; it's the only way to be sure
I feel a bit guilty and self-conscious about pointing toward the UK's Government Digital Service because a I know some of them and b they keep getting attention
The thing is they're doing really good work and in the words of Russell Davies it's not necessarily that they're doing anything particularly new or particularly insightful just the fact that they're actually allowed to get on and do it in the first place
Sometimes it feels like that last observation is the most depressing that but for humans being humans we could be so much further along
But I digress
The thing about the GDS and tying this all together with the recent zeitgeist and fetishisation for all things Apple and Jobs and design with a capital D is this: a focus on user needs and working from the user backward
If there is any arena in which the need for thinking from the user backward is apparent it's in the arena of politics and the provision of public services to citizens
I'm absolutely self-aware and wanting to not slip into some type of cult-like reverence for the mantras and principles that GDS are laying down but honestly: when you look at the rhetoric of the formation of the United States - and I've been to the Mall at Washington I've been to the Jefferson memorial and watched that video and damn if you don't tear up at the sheer optimism of We The People and When In The Course Of Human Events
That's the America that I love despite it not being the country that birthed me
So this thing about focusing on the end-user
With my cynical hat on I see GDS as an opportunistic Conservative government tasked with reducing the size of government seizing digital as a chance to reduce cost while retaining delivery
On the other hand knowing some of the people working at GDS I see them as seizing the opportunity to rethink and radically improve the experience of service delivery in a once-in-a-lifetime chance
This perfect storm of budgetary political capital with missionary zeal has enabled government to do something that on both sides of the Atlantic it's reluctant to: take the provision and delivery of service in-house instead of contracting out
I worry that this model doesn't work for the United States and/or that the imperatives and values don't quite sync up yet
There's a particularly American sensibility about a lack of trust in the federal model and the downright obsessive devolution of power down to the most local level
So while it makes sense in a way for federal standards to be set it's hard against a background of states' rights to say that Federal
gov gets to set the agenda and to not give states the opportunity or wherewithal to decide upon their own implementation
That said: one possible get-out is that of the regulation of interstate commerce which is one area in which states are or have been happy to cede some degree of responsibility and authority but which is always trotted out in terms of federal overreach
That was an aside: the real thing is this
If there is a manifesto for the digital age it might go something like this: Government For The Users By The Users
Digital is the excuse to focus on government as service delivery and keeping up its side of the bargain
Policy enacted through code is measurable
This might sound techno-utopian and practically baiting Evgeny Morozov but I don't think it is: no one is saying that the code fixes anything more that:
It's now desirable and tenable to enact policy ie deliver services through code
A focus on service delivery through code requires discipline of thinking - sloppy code doesn't work
The possibility of government emulating the Unix philosophy of being strict in what it emits but flexible in what it accepts
A focus on delivery and with GDS appearing to work completely through the stack from end-user delivery through to the composition of teams that perform that delivery all the way upward to ministerial policy feels like it removes the opportunity for a lot of wiggle room and ambiguity
Look: do you want everyone to get ID cards or not? Because we're designing the system that delivers that and you can't accidentally forget to service an entire audience when your focus is on the user
It is hard to see how government can outsource this function of service delivery to third parties
Historically they haven't been able to provide good solutions
Government especially in the United States is sensitive to accusations of profligacy but simultaneously to the exposure of risk
So requirements are overengineered and procurement more an exercise in risk reduction than anything else and procurement is the source of at least ten thousand words worth of its own material
But when you put it to politicians that service delivery is for the users it's hard to argue that risk reduction be the primary goal against which procurement be measured
Because ultimately those politicians are accountable to users in a way that board level management isn't
In our democracies there are always alternatives: they might not be different enough but there's always the threat of another guy
Even with gerrymandering
You can argue about what services a government should provide to its populace
But once agreed you cannot argue that they be inaccessible
That sort of thinking leads to losing votes
The user is after all where the rubber hits the road
And a policy doesn't matter a damn if it's not usable
I know there are a number of Code for America and GDS readers subscribed to this newsletter
Is this right? Migursky and Loosemore I'm looking pointedly at you because now I'm angry
Rambling again today I'm afraid
Do let me know what you think of this one because it feels somewhat unclearer to me than some of my recent episodes
I'm still preoccupied with the idea of there being nascent large-scale functional structures on the internet in the same way that neuroscientists study the structure of the human brain and discern individual units such as they are of functionality
There's so much to unpack here: what are the structures that are being built for starters never mind for what reason they're being built by us worker ants
What other sort of parallels with specieisation specialisation and evolution are possible in looking at the growth of the network? As we move to distinct services being made available as cloneable code and easy to spin up cloud instances and defining interfaces for those services e
g
the trend for -as-a-service it's easy for us to see the computer vision bit that gets shunted some data and the hearing human speech bit that gets shunted other data
There's no real co-ordination no one entity saying let's make an internet that understands the world but instead lots of little sub-problems that are busy being solved for whatever reason praise the market
Instead of vision systems evolved to detect potential predator threats like peripheral vision motion detection we have systems designed to detect trending topics
We know what kind of structures get produced when biological evolution and replicators are present in a physical environment
Actually that seems a bit like a silly statement: we don't know at all
We happen to know a lot of implicit things because we're the product of that environment
But the type of structures that we're erecting as infrastructure across the web that bear some sort of macro resemblance to what has been left in our brains are just weird
We have bits of brain that are good at detecting edges or faces or decoding the mush of sound that enters ears shaped just so but what are we making computers understand? Bits that recognise interestingness in images based on the droppings that we hairless apes leave around them? Bits that that clickstreams and try to work out relationships between them? If we're the product of a physical embodied intelligence then if you tell me that you know how to relate to or understand and intelligence that is embodied in the warp and weft of data I have no idea what you're on about
I did have a thought about these functional structures not quite yet having reach out into the physical world and realtime feedback as to those actions but I suppose autonomous drones are bringing that future closer
And also there's my physical-instantiation-privilege leaking through prizing the material world over the one made of data
So in that tradition of the lazyweb I would like this: what are the nascent neurological-analog structures of the internet? Where's the equivalent of Broca's region or an off-the-shelf visual cortex? Is the profusion of key-value stores the equivalent of laying down long-term memory? Put it this way: the internet has gone from not being able to recognise faces to being able to do within thirty years
I'm not necessarily a Kurzweil adherent but you've got to admit that's not bad going
That's how Robin Sloan described the team at BERG and the way they announced their latest project Cloudwash on how their product BERG Cloud could integrate with an off-the-shelf washing machine
It's worth watching the Cloudwash video; it's a particularly British and understated film explaining what might be so compelling about an internet-connected washing machine and the process that goes into designing such an object and one that you could see yourself using in your home
BERG's video doesn't fall into the trope of Jony Ive Explains Things Eagerly In A British Manner but Sloan has identified something uniquely British and lacking in Valley boosterism in the way that the team at BERG patiently explain what it is they're trying to achieve why and how
In the way that we have a fairly identifiable consensus of what makes a West Coast startup and I would argue that in the grand scheme of things an East Coast startup is practically indistinguishable I'd love to see some sort of Dogme 5-esque backlash or reaction to the Established Way Of Doing Things that takes it cues from a more British sensibility
It helps of course that the team behind BERG embrace their Britishness their shop-coats not lab coats mind and their emphasis on Getting Excited and Making Things
Where the Valley stands for hype and overstated rhetoric it's instead the British and BERGian way to be self-effacing and humble
Where America built itself the Lean Startup manifesto what sort of manifesto might emerge out of a particular British sensibility of being humble direct and curiously cautious?
This is not the Britain of empire and colonialism more a Britain of shop floor tinkerers and engineers who were doing things as hobbyists and accidentally invented entire industries not out of some sort of copy-and-pasted love of money but of material and technique and craftsmanship
This isn't that particular American sensibility of artisanal that's been sprouting lately but a different kind of retro
It's an open secret that the name of BERG is a direct reference to the fictional British scientist Quatermass and his British Experimental Rocket Group and while there are some things to say about the culture at BERG one could say that it could be a little testosteroney at times there's no denying that Messrs Schulze Webb and Jones forged a distinct atmosphere and culture there one refreshingly different from the dominant West Coast narrative
I said on Twitter that one of the irritating things about BERG is that when you see their documentation they make what they do seem easy and in implication make everyone else appear to be quite dumb in comparison
One look at the Cloudwash demo product is enough to convince you that yes there's actually value in connecting a washing machine to the internet once you sit down and think about it properly
Gruber talked about this in his post about working backwards to the technology and it's perhaps this aspect that BERG shows: their focus on design and technology in the service of design
On the one hand you could look at a company like BERG and its cloud product positioned as the glue for hardware manufacturers looking to make internet connected products as a solution looking for problems
What BERG have figured out though is that no one's really in the market for a solution that is also looking for problems: and that they have to lead the market to the solutions that BERG Cloud enables
It's a case of timing whether good or bad that the position they're in is that the best way of doing that is by inventing the products themselves
It used to be the case that BERG would simply do video demos - one criticism of them was that while they were great at design fiction they were even better at creating shiny videos
Cloudwash is anything but that: a real physical prototype that works because how else to sell the utility of BERG Cloud the product? It's this focus on the job-to-be-done the working back from the problem and illustrating how BERG Cloud fits into the solution that's interesting and in a deep way at odds with a stereotypical Silicon Valley technology-focussed startup culture
But: and with a heavy heart I have to admit it feels like Britain is the outlier with companies like BERG
The dominant narrative is not one of humility directness and curious caution
It is instead one of brash optimism and forging ahead - the inventing of technology for technology's sake
I wish BERG all the best and hope that they aren't relegated to the role of an externalised barely paid-for research and development outfit whose ideas can be copied without credit or remuneration by the industries they're hoping to improve
They deserve better than that
The sale of WhatsApp to Facebook brought into public eye the scale of internet companies again
The grammar when looking at consumer internet companies is to speak in DAUs and MAUs - daily and monthly active users - as a proxy for engagement and the theoretical maximum ability of a company to monetise that particular audience
It's interesting to think about what these large numbers mean and imply - not the purchase price - but the user base
So here is a list of numbers
There was a book I had growing up The Guinness Book of Answers a sort of printed-out one-volume Wikipedia that had everything from lists of Gods through to scientific units through to geographical information a sort of CIA factbook on steroids
This list reminds me of that book
A short last one this
Since my days at university before the 1st century I've been on-and-off reading the RISKS digest a moderated mailing list highlighting risks to the public in computers and related systems
Between it and Bruce Schneier's Cryptogram the two mailing lists deftly set out exactly how alarming it is that so much of our lives rely on software that can barely lay claim to the term 'engineering'
Apple's iOS and OS X SSL bug brought these two lists to the fore of my attention again and a discussion with a friend as to the state of Federal computer system procurement a particular conversation about the particular extent to which healthcare
gov was a cockup - and it's worse than you can imagine reminded me that it almost seems like we have a clinical inability to see the complexity in systems
I don't see it as merely something that's lacking political will more something we explicitly decide to pay no attention to
It is not outside the realm of possibility to engineer reliable software: an oft-cited article is They Right The Write Stuff a Fast Company piece from 1996
In the case of the US government the interstate highway system instituted in the 1950s established both a standard for the building of national network infrastructure as well as funding
The roads did not break
They carried the traffic
It is strange to me that we do not hold software to the same standard at least for one reason being that the complexity is hidden behind the veneer of interface
I do not know what it would take for software to be taken seriously
Every so often it's worth taking the time to stop and really look at what's happening around you
Case in point: yesterday Mt
Gox a major bitcoin exchange effectively ceased operations and by some accounts lost around 00k bitcoins
Stepping back from that we have a former collectible card game trading site - the Mt
Gox is actually Magic: The Gathering Online eXchange run out of Japan faciliating the exchange of a cryptocurrency based on the algorithmically difficult work distributed amongst hundreds of thousands of computers worldwide
This is stupendous
A hobbyist site ended up supporting the birth of a distributed currency the merits of which are debatable and are being debated
It's one thing to see that a sizeable portion of the world or at least an influential one would be sucked in to the mechanics of a card game that involves some sort of trading mechanic
It's also one thing to see that in theory a libertarian-esque anonymous cryptocurrency would find enough favour and attention in today's networked populace to take off
And that such cryptocurrency in possession of a good following would then find itself in need of an exchange mechanism
But of course in the entirely explicable at this point you would think we wouldn't be surprised world that we live in of course the intersection between those two sets results in well the situation that we have right now
I wish I had something more insightful to say other than a quip along the lines of isn't it interesting how the world keeps surprising us
There are so many factors at play here; from the crossover of one interest group into other and the fact that an increasingly connected populace allows ideas to spread so quickly and the fact that the code and thinking behind cryptocurrencies being open allowed a million clones to bloom
For anyone who thinks the future is going to get less weird I'm sorry to have to say that that's just not going to happen
There were a few things hidden in that Hyperland documentary: one which we're all familliar with now and actually felt like it was the one less touched on was the promise of the Interconnectedness of All Things a theme that Adams would visit in his Dirk Gently series of books and I note dirk an early project of Matt Webb now busy running a pocket universe on the substrate of his grey matter
The other was that of strong AI and the one definitely skirted over
Baker exhibited a phenomenal degree of intelligence and understanding one that in the guise presented in the programme a fully conversant interface and one that could easily pass the Turing test is clearly unobtainable at the moment
Our conversant interfaces at the moment are bits of black boxes of functionality word recognition engines hooked up to at best general purpose semantic knowledge graphs such as Wolfram Alpha
Siri and Google Now are not in any way going to fool us into thinking they are as smart as Baker
Fred Scharmen wrote to point out that the intelligence that was vested in the agents of our purported future instead was distributed amongst millions or billions of fleshy meat brains all Chinese-Rooming their way around in yet another example of an EasyHard problem
It is easy as it were for Amazon to mine the purchasing habits of millions of shoppers and to attempt to provide meaningful and serendipitous suggestions as to other things I might want to buy
Is this instead some mythical hand of the market? Are we ants burrowing around in the material of the internet leaving behind patterns and traces for machines to obsess over in order to determine our meaning? Because the meaning that we're able to impart to machines and the understanding they derive from us when we choose to speak to them explicitly are shown only in terms of brittle speech: we must construct still our queries just so from pre-ordained blocks that we have already taught the machines in order for them to fulfil our query properly
And what of long-term understanding of our intent? Scharmen saidi that instead of relying on artificially intelligent software to act as curator and serendipitist people now perform that service for each other: we do not have agents we have but ourselves
I don't think that's strictly true: as Adams says we are the ones creating the data and the shapes that we cannot see: it's the machines that construct the trending topics and are helping to tease out meaning from the streams and feeds based on admittedly basic mechanisms of feedback that we have built in
There is not I don't think the Amazon equivalent of people who have read the following on the web also read but the way we self-select the networks that we're part of provides some of that functionality
Perhaps the exuberance of Adams manifested it in the absolute trust of the algorithm that the machine would be able to understand us perfectly when all along it would be a cooperation of sorts some sort of symbiosis
This makes me think of the internet as discrete parts; and the possibility that it might in some misunderstood way act as a distributed brain
It feels like there are distinct neurological structures embedded on the internet and that at the moment issues like corporate self-interest have imposed some sort of vicious lobotomy preventing those structures from implementing cross-talk
Imagine what could happen when the cat-recognising part gets input from the purchase recognition part gets input from the face-recognition part
What's interesting about the way we're spreading code on the net is that this intelligence is also getting distributed: as one part learns how to recognise faces because the substrate that the net runs on is so general-purpose it is near enough that any part can suddenly also include that dedicated structure
At the same time there's this weird feedback mechanism where the instrumentation that the internet has and I realise that I've digressed way off base from the talk of agents is dealing with the very bottom of Maslow's hierarchy of needs and is generating again through some sort of invisible hand the type of content it thinks we want hence all the Five Amazing Secret Tips To Get Rid Of Belly Fat
These algorithmic utterings that are farmed out to writers and then produced - are they not some sort of Chinese Room in and of itself? Would you know if there were some sort of real intelligence behind their production or are they merely following a bunch of ill-defined and not particularly clearly articulated rules?
All this makes me feel that the idea of a singular agent seems increasingly unlikely barring an accidental Giant Leap Forward in the creation of a personality-focussed general intelligence
The internet itself taken as a whole with weather recognition bits and fault-tolerant bits and so on is a much bigger thing and why would it need a human face anyway? What sort of bizarre personality would be in front of such strange machinery?
That said the internet is brittle in the same way that biological life and humans are brittle
Poke a human in the right place with the right pressure and it'll just keel over and die
It turns out that one line of code - in this case ill-advised lack of braces and yet more proof that Goto be considered harmful - can effectively compromise the equivalent of an immune system
And then when you think about computers and the internet in terms of infrastructure - where's the equivalent of public health? We talk about anti-virus software but we don't treat what's increasingly turning into critical infrastructure indeed invisibly beneath the notice of the populace whether it's actually hooked up to critical services turning into services that are relied upon or suborned to produce DDOS against critical services themselves
Software is brittle in the same way that humans are
It doesn't even self-heal
There were obviously? no unit tests that caught the OS X and iOS SSL failure and once in the wild and deployed end-user systems themselves weren't able to diagnose themselves in a method of self-reflectivity to notice that something critical felt wrong
I'm empty today
Wife and baby are off for a week possibly longer trip to see the maternal grandparents one of whom we're worried about
I am now catapulted into bachelor land with a profusion of games consoles a PS I haven't even plugged in yet more movies and unfinished games than I know how to watch or play and the weird inkling feeling that I shouldn't be ordering delivery pizza
Yet
There are so many things that I want to do: like live-blogging Hyperland or watching through Stealth Elysium the Robocop remake the Total Recall remake and doing a commentary or more honestly falling asleep for a bit
Everything feels quite disjointed and it's not just because the house looks like a 2 month old whirlwind has it it
This is just a one-off though
This is what depression can feel like
It might feel like it again but the new medication that I'm on has taken the edge off somewhat
It's hard to explain what it feels like other than a complete emptiness; in one conversation I've had with a doctor it's like looking inside your own head and finding something filling up the space but that it's a featureless sphere impenetrable
Medication then
And writing
With that then tonight's activity: watching Hyperland a 0 minute documentary written by Douglas Adams for the BBC
You can watch along if you want
It's important to remember that Hyperland was written in 1990 before any talk of the Information Superhighway; indeed what everyone was excited about at the time was the promise of Multimedia - the mixing together of sound video and text into some new hitherto impossible whole
If you were a child in the UK in between 1984 and 1986 you likely participated in a nascent country-wide attempt at producing a multimedia work; the BBC Domesday project
I think it's important to take a look at Hyperland and the other historical fiction that we have that paint a vision of a possible future if only because it's interesting to see what our grasp used to be
It feels and here I recognise that I'm falling into the bias of the Wonderful Yesterday that we had more fantastic dreams and that instead what we have now is some sort of worldwide crisis of lack of imagination
Was it because our reach exceeded our grasp and now we're able to simply produce what we had dreamed of grasping when we were younger?
Hyperland opens on a slumbering Adams recollecting a dream that he had to get rid of his television: I dreamt just to get rid of the thing
I thought there must be a better way of spending my time like walking to the nearest scrap heap and throwing the wretched object away
We see the power of television: of Margaret Thatcher showing how television can be so selective in the alluring images it presents to us while we pan up to yet another television in the scrap heap showing soft-core porn
The multitude of content that television offers from an evangelical preacher to a documentary about breadmaking
And of course advertising
Adams is perplexed at this: It seems such a waste of technology
Maybe in the future we'll find a better use to put it all to
- and we cue dream sequence music with the strumming harp
This is a familiar refrain
The potential of technology - and what Adams was seeing was the power of the image and its might in broadcasting singular images; nation speaking unto nation
Surely there are those who ask we can do better than this?
As we skip into the future Adams sees news broadcasts of Japan pegging the Yen to the Dollar in exchange for California we need only substitute China and that the effects of Global Warming are finally becoming apparent well we all know about that
But as Tom Baker interrupts surely he is tired of linear non-interactive television
Baker asks whether Adams is tired of a television that sort of happens to you that doesn't involve you
And for us now the familiar strike of lean-back versus lean-forward entertainment of passive versus participatory content
Of user choice
My name is Tom he proclaims and I'm your agent
Ah agents
We had such dreams for these personifications of algorithms in the belief that people would find it easier to act with a simulacra of a human being than with well rawly exposed user interface controls
The truth as it turns out nearly twenty five years later is somewhere in between
Now we have virtual assistants at airports instructing us on how to dispose of our excess liquid goods but every day millions - billions - of people interact with something more like a command line prompt when they type their questions into Google's maw
As an Agent Baker explains he's here to do Adams' every slightest bidding
To fetch carry work tirelessly all on Adams' behalf always ready always willing
An artificial and completely customisable personality a software application running on his computer providing instant access to any digital information existing in the world anywhere - or what we would refer to as on the internet
Is there anything I can do for you now Mr
Adams sir?
Well yes you can stop being so obsequious for a start
Now we're presented with Baker's control panel which materialises around him
The thought that people would care as much about the how information is presented to them as opposed to its accuracy or timeliness or if in this particular imagined future all information retrieved is correct and timely all that matters left is the manner in which it's presented is interesting
We do not have at the moment this level of customisation in our interaction with services like Google Now or Siri
What we do have instead of a curt/servile slider to adjust manner is in some cases some degree of control over tone of voice but normally even this is added as an afterthought
Facebook still has as language options English Pirate and English Upside Down and on Google there used to be vestiges of such a sense of humour in the ability to browse the site in Pig Latin
But as a rule tone of voice is one-size fits all and this has as much to do with the hard AI problem of natural language processing as it does will how many writers does Apple employ for Siri anyway? Indeed Siri's personality has come under fire for having enough of a point of view to make her unique
All of the control panel options that Adams plays with are within the realm of current feasibility - they just require a big enough team of D modellers and texture artists for the dress and species/3D rendering options but as always it comes down to the uncanny valley of actual user interaction through speech
I'm not sure what the state of the art is in accurately reproducing accents but let's just say I'm assuming a large number of voice talent artists would be required to build up the phoneme database or whatever
It's here that we encounter our first application error and crash in a manner reminiscent of Mac OS 's Bomb and the usual promise that the next version of the software will be more reliable
It may have been 1990 but it looks like that particular trope of the software industry had by then been incredibly well established

Baker then presents to us a crash-course in the history of hypertext covering Vannevar Bush Ted Nelson the MIT Media Lab and the Multimedia Lab in San Francisco then Robert Abel
It's the agent aspect of Hyperland that continues to stand out at this point
You have a sufficiently Turing-fooling avatar that Adams is able to converse with a piece of software that can do natural language recognition as well as speech summarise information about the subject of hypertext pick out the most influential people in its evolution as a mode of communication and also talk reflexively about itself
It can also Librarian-from-Snow Crash-style take conversation forks and handle interruptions and then return seamlessly
It's interesting that one of the hallmarks of the future of interaction with information would require so much personalisation and assistance
As if humans would not be able to navigate such data on their own arguably we cannot but that we would require instead a fake persona one that we could converse with as if we would another human to help us understand and navigate
One wonders if this is a particularly paternalistic view of how we need to experience the mass of information out there rather than a more libertarian have-at-it attitude
Here we digress as Adams asks why there are moving icons on the screen - Baker explains they're micons invented by Hans Peter Brandmo at MIT in 989 essentially anchored animated gifs and we're whisked off into demo land where a micon of Ted Nelson appears on top of Hans' video interview and Adams taps it to jump to a video interview
Adams asks how to go back - something we all asked when confronted with hypertext for the first time - and Baker quips that one could ask him or instead tap the 'go back' button which looks like a minimalist fish hook
Adams complains that he's completely lost and after a conversation with Baker Baker provides a guide and they start at the beginning with Nelson explaining the work of Bush
The completely lost and guide nature is familiar too: those who aren't familiar with the internet can describe themselves as overwhelmed and many of our first interactions with the net were through directory sites like Yahoo! and other editorial like the NCSA Site of the Day
When you could travel anywhere view anything and it was all at your behest where would you start?
Nelson introduces us to Bush's Memex through more video
At this point and this is purely an artefact of this being a documentary made for television and the format of the documentary being video as Nelson is speaking various micons pop up microfilm for example pops up as he explains that the Memex acts as a front-end for a store of information it's worth point out that there's a degree of authorship on show in Adams' demo
Because there's no text as such and one would instead imagine that if Hyperland were an actual application instead of a film then the subtitled text would itself be hyperlinked it appears that there's only limited user choice: editorial choices are made at opportune moments to introduce the reader to other concepts an alternate explanation though would be that Baker himself as agent is injecting relevant micons into the video stream as Adams is watching based on what Baker assumes or knows to be Adams' level of knowledge about the topic
Seeing as we're already practically envisaging strong AI we may as well

Nelson remarks that Englebart inventor of word processing and the mouse was probably influenced by the idea of the Memex
Adams then interrupts and asks for Baker to come back and points out that he had been watching video of Brandmo but now there appears to be a Ted Nelson strand running through everything isn't there always
He asks Baker: Does it all interconnect?
Absolutely! The system is constantly at work in the background sifting its data for connections
Every time you start something I start to line up other things that you might want to see
And again we're at a curiously different envisioning of hypertext and hypermedia one mediated by impressively intelligent agents doing our bidding that are able to understand not only our intent but by implication the semantic content of every piece of digital information on the world's networks
It's worth it to point out that the links between concepts in Adams' future aren't static as they are on our world wide web they aren't necessarily manually encoded as humans would do on Wikipedia
They emerge agent-backed from an innate understanding of the knowledge embedded in the system
It's not clear how the agents would do this but it implies a strong ability of natural language processing and meaning to understand how different concepts interrelate
Adams starts Baker off on a query about the Atlantic
Baker throws up Ecology Oceanography Shipping a Live Feed and Literature all represented as micons
In contrast Wikipedia will throw up the article for the Atlantic Ocean which covers subjects such as geography cultural significance ocean floor water characteristics climate history economy terrain environmental issues bordering countries and major ports and harbours
Adams taps on the Live Feed and up pop micons for the Labrador Basin and the Azores-Gibraltar Ridge
Adams expresses incredulity that he could actually access live video data from submersibles via satellite
On Literature up pop micons for Coleridge Melville Conrad Hemingway CS Forrester and More
And then upon tapping Coleridge micons for Critical History Drugs The Rime of the Ancient Mariner and Other Works
Adams taps on Other Works and from then Kubla Khan
But then Ted Nelson turns up and Adams asks why
Baker remarks that he likes to arrange meaningful coincidences and this is quite a good one
The idea that an agent would engineer serendipity is in fact one that we do have: all the way back to Flickr and its interesting photos page and the intent behind Dopplr to help engineer serendipitous connections between travelers
This serendipity is now engineered in other ways where it's not necessarily presented as serendipity or meaningful coincidence but instead as something where the utility is far more stark: Jobs You Might Be Interested In for example or Other People Also Purchased
It's not too hard to imagine a future where Google or another company with lots of access to browsing data starts providing recommendations for content Stumbleupon-style in a truly mass manner
Nelson then takes us through that unifying world of anyone being able to add documents to a central repository accessible through telephone laser beam or satellite it would have to be available to everyone everywhere
And because of literary tradition he calls it Xanadu
And as we cut back to Baker reading the text of the poem as it scrolls by on screen Adams taps words for definitions and phrases for explanation
Baker then shows Adams a piano roll of Bach's fugue in C Minor that Adams fails to recognise until its played and Adams supposes that such a system one that is good at recognising shapes and dealing with music could also be good at teaching music and unearthing the patterns that are hidden beneath the surface
Now we see Robert Winter's interpretation of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony in a demo of an early multimedia application published by The Voyager Company in 989 which seeing as it's a real application that shipped isn't one that I feel we can learn particularly much from as it's an example of the promise of multimedia applied and can draw a direct line from Robert Winter's CD-ROM all the way through to something like The Orchestra on the iPad
In a way it's disappointing to see that conventions set down in 1989 still hold strong and that there haven't been other more successful ways of presenting music
When we come back Adams is musing on the fact that once information is digitised it's easy for computers to see shapes and patterns in the data that's been collected
Baker races ahead when Adams mentions Vonnegut and mentioning that he'd scanned all of Vonnegut's work found a piece of writing about shapes in stories that he presupposed Adams was going to mention in an I'm Feeling Lucky or autocomplete-y kind of way
Again because Baker is a personified agent his interruption feels more of well an interruption rather than the UI trope now of autocomplete-as-you-type being the similar hovering over your shoulder as you think but the conversational nature intrudes more
What Baker does here is interesting and points more to his fantastical intelligence
Assuming correctly that Adams had just spotted a link between the ability of a computer to identify patterns and Vonnegut's theory that stories may be graphed on a good/ill fortune y-axis and that time progressed through plot be well plotted on the x-axis Baker barrels on and outlines how a plot from Nelson Rockefeller's life EastEnders or a bag lady's might fit in to Vonnegut's graph before moving on to mapping various creation myths on to Vonnegut's graph too and showing how they exhibit similar shapes
There's a bit of irritation I have with Baker's personality here almost as if he's Hypersplaining - so eager to teach and to explain things to Adams it's as if Adam is unable to get a word in edgeways which this being a documentary written by Adams is clearly by design
We then progress through a Google Image Search-esque search based upon Baker agreeing with Adams's supposition that seeing as all digital information is just shapes computers can look for them pretty easily and off we go on a trapezoid hunt before landing back at Picasso's Guernica and by extension Bob Abel's Picasso's Guernica of which we experience a demo
What's striking looking now at what must have been so exciting about multimedia was that it was simply a new way of packaging and providing an accessible reference to a particular subject or piece of information
While the Beethoven's Ninth example allows us to jump around and explore different parts of the score visually the Guernica example seems to mainly consist of a number of video interviews of interesting sources related to the material
Sure there's user choice here in that the editorial journey is chosen by the user rather than a tv programme editor but perhaps that's 5 years of cynicism leaking in at me toward the experience of well Yet Another Multimedia CD-ROM
Certainly the fact that this information is now more accessible rather than not at all is a major step forward but there's something distinct about the way self-contained information is presented on these CD-ROMs versus network hyperlinked information
CD-ROMs of those types ended up feeling like particularly dense TV shows with chapter marks and not necessarily as big a deal as fundamental interconnectivity and user-initiated publishing
Abel finishes up by cueing up a 0 second film clip of what you as a user might be able to experience if you took your own version of Guernica
And that would certainly be an interesting thought indeed if the rights to the material on the CD enabled remixing and republishing
But as we know with the benefit of hindsight that rarely happened - and again we're dealing with an edited package of audiovisual content
Adams muses that if this type of experience is to be understood properly a new grammar or language needs to be invented to allow people to deal with it
Baker uses examples from the language of the moving image - jump cuts zooms pans etc
- and it still feels unlikely as it is that we are as far away from a grammar of interaction despite our best efforts to catalogue it and design for it in chief because software is so malleable
The Multimedia Lab then takes us through a backgrounder in Multimedia - how it's a new medium and how they're dealing with creating and experimenting with the grammar for it
About how multimedia allows you to bounce around and compare different points of view which strikes me not necessarily as a particular aspect of multimedia itself but again more of hypertext
In a somewhat prophetic comment one of the researchers mentions how an audience involved in a particular drama might want to find out more about it and would embark on their own idiosyncratic path to find out more background information which happily describes anyone who's ever fallen down the rabbit hole of a JJ Abrams story
We're taken through a demo of Life Story a multimedia version of a BBC dramatisation of the discovery of the structure of DNA by Watson and Crick and again we see this interesting assumption that people would pause one task and then operate on another - watch a bit of video then do a bit of interaction
Maybe it was because the true impact of Moore's Law hadn't hit home yet but in twenty five year's time computing power would be so cheap and accessible that you could sit in front of your TV and have it streaming video in the background whilst you purposely paid attention to the second computing device in your hand
In this case the research project of Life Story is essentially chapter marks and navigation for a bunch of linear video which then pauses and adds context
The researcher cutely talks about each screen ie tapping on the links section from the transcript as a new pamphlet of information that would teach the viewer about DNA
Our next demo is children playing with Amanda Goodenough's Inigo Gets Out a form of interactive storytelling a Hypercard stack being played with where areas on the screen are hot-clickable
Inigo Gets Out is instantly recongisable as being somewhat like a graphical point-and-click adventure game albeit in story format and its ultimate progeny is that of the kids iPad book with directly manipulable areas
Goodenough raises the valid point that you may well have branching storylines that converge on the same ending which you pretty much have to do unless you're the kind of person who has figured out how to deal with the combinatorial explosion involved in producing branching narrative but if the branches themselves that lead to the same ending are satisfying stories in their own right then that's perfectly fine
This is pretty much the only and entire problem I have with such choice-based branching interactive stories: it's hard enough to write one good story never mind fifty
Or even ten
We then skip over to Brad deGraf and Michael Wahrman talking about digital puppetry and anything historical to do with realtime computer graphics is always going to seem amusing in hindsight
They say though that they had too-realistic human faces in their rendering and that they had to dial it back so as not to confuse people which just makes me wonder if they hadn't instead fallen unintentionally into the uncanny valley
Scarily one of them suggests that the rendered faces could be truly obnoxious and your fridge could moan at you if you wandered into the kitchen and didn't pay attention to it and it would try to attract your attention
Though it's possible this segment was merely baiting the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation
And finally we see a NASA prototype virtual reality display from AMES called Cyberiad and one of the reasons why I thought it would be fun to take a look at Hyperland again
Because with things like Oculus Rift and Facetime echoing Tom Selleck's You Will narration that I would tuck my baby in at night from a phone booth close it feels like we are finally managing to reach the grasp we sold ourselves in the early 0s
Just in a different way
We had all of these ideas that had been brought to life in so many different yet ham-fisted ways
We had a nascent worldwide communications network first in ARPA and at the same time in BBSes then in Usenet and Telnet and Gopher then in the web then somewhat persistent but slow connectivity and now persistent fast mobile connectivity in our pockets
It turned out that we could imagine all of those things and that now in their mundanity we're able to bring to life what we were excited about twenty five years ago
How then do we make what was new and exciting but inaccessible twenty five years ago new and exciting again? Because it should be
The fact that we can communicate practically for free with so many people around the world that we can publish that we can interact in so many different ways and in different contexts should be amazing
And because we are human we do it in as many ways as we are human and in all the boring and mundane ways
The fear as summed up at the end of the programme is that all this technology and virtual reality would remove people from 'real reality'
And that was before we even had this stuff in our pockets
Adams moves the time-slider up to 005 doffs a 2005 BBC virtual reality cap and off we are again into a Gibsonian chrome-textured matrix
Here's one reckon I just had yes another one you can add it to the pile that everyone else has had about WhatsApp and the reaction to its purchase: humans are good at surface
We have lots of things like neural structure for recognising surface level features like faces or edges or inertia or top-level physical properties of the world
So for most of us WhatsApp is what it presents: a messaging application that runs on a smartphone
But the real value in WhatsApp was the infrastructure behind it: the invisible mechanism that transports a godawful number of messages worldwide and routes them seamlessly
That is potentially worth about nineteen billion dollars -- especially when you think about mobile messaging in the previously-known-only-as-SMS and the value and economy it generated
So: all this talk about posthumanism and mind uploading is interesting - in particular Rameez Naam's rebuttal of what you might call the Cult of Singularity - but what got me thinking was: what are the neural structures that would be particularly beneficial to a post-human? What sort of things would it be great to have unconscious recognition of? You wouldn't even have to look for example to understand the infrastructure behind a particular network you would just know at some sort of atavistic level
Or what would a neural structure devoted to recognising the implications and rules behind network or graph theory imply? How might you hack together those types of brain structures?
It feels like it's this type of lack of instinctual understanding of that prevents us from dealing with long-term existential threats
The things that threaten us now include complex interdependent webs of infrastructure creating outcomes that we don't foresee or include outside context events like a giant rock coming down upon is that will require complex interdependent webs of infrastructure and the rapid design and implementation of those webs
When we can now produce mathematical proofs that we can't understand and indeed financial trading instruments that are essentially black boxes what type of human augmentation is needed to deal with the present nevermind the future?
As ever Ted Chiang's already written a story about how this might feel - if you haven't read his short story Understand I highly recommend it
The whole Star Trek: TNG computing infrastructure universe continues to dwell on my mind
When Geordi and Data invent a new way of inverting the positronic emissions in the deflector dish to close a dangerous subspace eruption what exactly happens? Do they have to call up Starfleet Engineering HQ to get at the firmware of the deflector? Does Geordi have to turn off the deflector to flash it and they kind of have to stop the engines and come to relative dead stop while the deflector reboots? In our mundane future does the deflector dish subsystem actually run a tiny embedded ftp server and Geordi has to upload a new binary firmware to it and then wait while it grabs a new DHCP address from the Main Computer? And then after that does Geordi or more probably Data because no one likes writing documentation write some documentation for the firmware diffs for the deflector and then push them upstream to Starfleet Engineering's Github repo and then they get merged in and then on Patch Tuesday Starfleet pushes out a bunch of updates? Is part of Engineering's job basically going around all of the ship's systems and looking at those little red badges with numbers in them and then going: oh looks like we need to install a system update on the environmental systems today to improve O efficiency? In fact if there is a Starfleet Engineering repo on Github is that how they recruit engineers into the Academy? Look at who's contributed the most to Starfleet projects? Or has the consumerisation of IT finally reached the 24th Century and when you're a brand new Ensign with your newly-issued PADD do you head into the Starfleet App Store and go put on your favourite messaging apps? Does Data publish apps in the store? Also charts! How do you discover what app you might want to install on your brand new Warp Core? Is the model of Data and Geordi the logical conclusion of Dev/Ops writing functionality on the fly inside a mission envelope and then deploying it? Are they an effective team? Does Data even write code? Does anyone in Starfleet write code? Does everyone in the Federation Know how to Code?
So many questions
It's this kind of thing that you need an updated technical manual for
Google's Tango project has me giddily excited not least of which because it marks the return to public eye of Johnny Lee Chung at Google's new Advanced Technology and Projects ATAP group
The telling sentence in Tango's writeup for me is this: The goal of Project Tango is to give mobile devices a human-scale understanding of space and motion
because a lot of people seem to have gotten caught up in the various demos and videos of the hardware that currently exist
What the goal sounds like is being able to give mobile computing devices the sense of proprioception to increase their situational awareness another step toward embodied computing with more context
It's not necessarily about Google being able to map the inside of your house and retaining that data that feels to me the absolute bottom layer but more what that knowledge enables the device that you're carrying to do
There's a whole lot of implicit information that we process in terms of our interactions with the world that are dealt with on a purely subconcious level - things like how fast we're moving and where we're moving just in terms of our limbs and how we understand where we are in D space and what our relation in that space is to other objects
As an aside it's interesting that part of the way that we're designing computers to see actually meshes with the way children think we see
There's this thing the emission theory of sight which is where our eyes reach out into the world and paint it into being
Which is pretty much what IR depth cameras like the Kinect do spraying a pseudorandom dot grid out into the world at frequencies that aren't visible to us bathing the world in little photonic tentacles that reflect back and describe the shape of the world to them
Our eyes don't see like that of course we don't emit anything and merely receive reflected photons on our retina
But isn't it interesting how we're solving the problem for the intelligence we're creating

One: the on-purpose infection of individuals with parasites for the creation of superhumans or: has anyone rebooted Catwoman's origin story with her being created by a union with toxoplasmosis yet?
Two: Dan Simmons' Ilium/Olympos series of novels has a somewhat throwaway reference to a pervasive instrumentation and communications network that covered all living things some sort of networked Gaia
So here's a realtime forest map
Paul Rissen and I'm struggling to find a way to deal with this in writing without feeling like I'm a DJ with a call-in talk radio show asked if I had any further reckons about the whole Marvel Universe API and the weak signal of Irrational Games' implosion
I have a shtick of why and what I'm interested in about internet native storytelling
It mainly stems from the holy-shit moment of The Beast one of the first Alternate Reality Games back in 001 where great writing thanks Sean Stewart met great game design thanks Elan Lee and an almost creepy knowledge of how to use the internet as a storytelling medium as opposed to a transport mechanism
For those unclear: YouTube is more transport mechanism than medium its benefit is mainly in enabling distribution of video to audience the trappings of interactivity that it does have are baubles around the edges; whereas the internet itself enables storytelling of a qualitatively different types
The defining characteristic of the Internet that we have today is the link
We're maybe just maybe post-link with the world of practically balkanised mostly hermetically sealed app experiences on mobile but for the most part hypertext has won
Things as it were connect to other things
It's those connections that are so interesting and that enable a lot of what makes the internet so great
There were two talks that I think attacked the same subject but from different angles at last year's XOXO: the first from Evan Williams who perhaps has single-handedly no matter how much Dave Winer may protest been at the centre of enabling people put things that link to other things on the internet
The second was Mike Rugnetta's about well the entire internet and culture
You should watch them because they really are very good but if you want to watch only one then I'd recommend Mike's
So
Links
Links are what makes the internet the internet
And if there were a thing that was really really the internet then I would have a hard time coming up with something better than the wiki which is essentially nothing more than just a giant ball of links compressed together under a single namespace and even lets you put your own things that other things can link to in it! If you want!
Look here's a pop-psychology reference for me to throw in to prove a point without any real citation in some sort of Malcolm Gladwell-alike impression: you know that feeling of Flow? I get it when I fall into tvtropes
I just click from article to article endlessly exploring a maze of twisty passages all alike in terms of textual content being injected into my brain through my eyeballs
But unlike linear fiction and because of the link the path that I take can be unique to me
I still have an entire fictional universe that I can explore and that universe need not be in the way that Wikis are currently limited to mainly textual content
There's been I reckon a preoccupation with the editing side of the Wiki as opposed to the consumption side
What does it look like when a work of fiction is created by an author as a wiki and then experienced as one? Can that be episodic? When the emphasis is on the act of aimlessly traveling through a morass of universe? It feels like there's something epistolaric about it: because a navigated series of documents
Let me also be clear that I don't mean some sort of choose-your-own adventure interactive wiki-novel
For a variety of reasons that would be dumb
More that there can exist an authored text with a defined event of beginning middle and end where the reader explores it non-linearly without affecting the plot
It would be as if someone had written something like World War Z and just dumped it on your desk out of order and you had to piece together the universe story
The counterargument to something like this is: gosh that sounds like an awful lot of work
And compared to consuming regular linear media yes it is
But then so is spending time trawling through TVTropes and that's why I invoked pop-psychology favourite Flow earlier
Because if you have a Flow card in your hand then you can play it any time and it trumps any other argument someone may have so there
All this is to say that I remain excited about the possibilities of the Marvel Universe API
Because once you have an API you have Things and when you have Things they can link to other Things and Operations can be performed upon those Things to Transform them and before you know it you have more Things
The API and this really is off-the-top-of-my-head-reckoning is in a fiction sense providing you with ready made entities that can be played with
Sure you could build Marvel Universe Reference Guides and all that stuff but that's not as fun as making your own splinter universe and still be able to have it all tie together individual instances of parent entity objects retain their relationships right? So you can use your entity as a point of reference and use it to pivot around different universes
Duh

I had a piece brewing in Medium for a while that just kind of petered out so as an experiment I'm trying to rewrite it here in a shorter and more concise manner
So here are the things that caught my attention:
Item one: 3AndMe's first TV commercial
Check out the motion graphics and the structure that they use to portray information
They say we're from the Future and we're here Now!
Item two: Oh right that reminds me exactly of the kind of stuff you see in Children of Men
Item three: In fact there's an entire visual shorthand for selling the future and portraying the future that's been developed in film and television over the past few decades
One good place to see that is at the Typeset In The Future blog
The thing here is that the future that was always a few years away and that we've been exposed to on film and in fiction is tentatively touchable
Nest with Google behind it will surely embark on an advertising campaign for Smart Home Appliances
Ads featuring a pseudo-intelligent voiced personal assistant are now an actual real thing and not the kind of thing that you see comped in through some motion graphics in a Tom Cruise SF thriller
One of the reasons why Spike Jonze's vision of the future in Her is so - in a way alluring if not technically accurate - is that the guy cut his chops in the advertising world
He was we should remember the guy who anthropomorphised an IKEA lamp to us
In short Jonze knows how to sell
So here's the thing: advertising has already anthropomorphised things
Advertising already knows how to tweak your heart strings and show you that P&G Winter Olympics ad that will have you bawling hands down within thirty seconds
Because they - we - have this thing down to an art
Now in a very short amount of time all of that machinery is going to be brought to bear on selling you the stuff you thought was in the future
If software is eating the world and software's going to be powering all the formerly dumb things we've had in it then you can be sure that those physical things with software are going to be advertised in a way to you
Where this gets even more interesting is that the advertising is going to have to explain what these things do
Why you should have a thing in your home that is connected to the network and can talk to you
And well explaining outbreaks of the future to people? That's going to be pretty cool
Matt Locke wrote in with the caveat that Always On doesn't mean Always Available: this makes sense with teens and children who have less control over their time than adults do in theory right? I mean I know who has control over my time and it isn't necessarily me and it more begins with a M and ends with an icrosoft Outlook Meeting Request
Now what I'd probably do is point at someone who actually knows what they're talking about like danah boyd in terms of real behaviour of teens and how they treat persistent connectivity
My gut instinct which also feels like a somewhat wrong reckon is that people who've grown up with persistent connectivity have roughly the same amount of stress ie not a significant difference or reduction and anxiety in terms of being overwhelmed with a deluge of incoming information
I do wonder if there's enough of an audience for an equivalent to the slow-food movement which is kind of something that the long read trend is addressing
A lot of the reaction that I saw to the new Facebook Paper app was about how the infinite vertical scroll method of displaying News Feed items was more efficient which speaks directly to the way those particular people saw the task of checking a stream - a list of items that must each be evaluated quickly before moving onto the next because the stream is never-ending
But there are different types of feeds and streams: in particular Twitter's more ephemeral version places less pressure and grants permission if not explicitly but implicitly to miss items in the stream
Facebook with its algorithm places the burden upon itself to determine what the most important and relevant information might be
So what does a slow or rate-limited feed look like? Extra credit for identifying a business model behind it too
Matthaeus Krenn posted a concept for a new car user interface - I last talked about cars in episodes twelve and thirteen which looks pretty interesting mainly for its initial concept of you-don't-have-to-look-just-put-your-fingers-anywhere on a touchscreen
I see some problems with it lack of glanceable information for example and wonder about the cognitive overhead of having to remember whether I need to use two three or however many fingers to operate a control and how far apart they have to be in the absence of visual feedback
That's the thing about physical controls: you can kind of see how you need to or can use them and it feels like there are a bunch of Everyday Thing Norman-type affordances that have been lost
If you're British and use Siri then you've probably heard the plummy tones of well I can't describe it in any way other than British Siri Wanker
So in terms of designing a service here's a whole not necessarily new but deep domain area that is suddenly becoming more relevant
Time was you'd kind of laugh about Brian Eno designing the aural identity for Microsoft Windows but here are the super dumb things that I put to you:
a For a certain group of people hearing British Siri makes them want to punch British Siri in the face no matter how useful he may be;
b Samantha in Spike Jonze's Her is voiced by Scarlett Johansson;
c JARVIS in the Marvel Cinematic Universe is voiced by Paul Bettany being an English Butler;
d The Computer in Star Trek: The Next Generation is voiced by Majel Barrett in somewhat haughty BDSM mode; and
e Sigourney Weaver in Galaxy Quest
The super arbitrary base-level insight thing that I'm going to pull out of this is: hey voice casting matters! And for all the strides that have been made in terms of attention being paid to copywriting and the inevitable wrong lessons being learned or being followed blindly cargo-cult fashion from standouts in the field like Innocent and Flickr and again GDS in maintaining that Writing Is Design if we're talking about conversational interfaces ha then we're also paying attention to a whole bunch of things like prosody and tone and pauses and and and
The assertion that British people are highly attuned to things like accent and dialect is a bit of a side-show we all are: it's just a matter of degree and sensitivity
Orthogonal to all of this is the realisation that Overly Friendly Nicey-Nice copy is but one axis on the continuum of how you can write and that if there were for example an obsequiousness setting that might be fun or at least interesting to try out
This is to say that one of the reasons why Theodore fell in love with Samantha is that whether or not she actually had one she simulated having a personality pretty well
Oh and she was an actual human being who could read meaning into lines
It's easy for us to pay attention to the uncanny valley of computer generated imagery
That doesn't mean there isn't a similar uncanny valley of synthesised voice
An aside: Chinese Room style artificial intelligence at least in the delivery of the intelligence sounds more likely to me in the short term where zero-hour workers pretty much read out and relay what Siri-the-system says to say to you delivering the intonation almost by accident

There's a long history of presence on the internet: from commands like finger on multi-user UNIX systems to the peripheral-vision and green indicators of ICQ and AIM to the green light on Facebook chat and experiments like BERG's Availabot
But all of these things seem to be kludges and shims for a non-persistently connected world
Again running with my Star Trek as stand-in for the future theme the presumption is that everyone is always available online and connected
That someone wouldn't be connected is what's surprising: Commander Riker tries to get hold of Data and his combadge chirps in an unhappy way CUT TO everyone on the Bridge looking perplexed like Data's gone AWOL
Which essentially he has because in the 4th Century on a star ship if you're not on the network there's something not right with you
Riker would try a few more times ask the Computer to locate Mr
Data Mr
Data is not aboard the Enterprise and then cue creepy music and CUT TO TITLES
This is where Snapchat designed as it were for that golden of gold audiences the Teenagers makes an interesting choice if I'm not reading too much into it: it doesn't have from what I can make out any presence indicators
The presumption is that of course you're online and of course your recipients are they'll just get around to reading it when they do
If anything this is one of the shifts that I think legitimately shows the difference between so-called digital natives and immigrants
To natives connectivity just is
A lot of us in industry have grown up with the sound of Hayes v
4 modems pinging away in the background or remembering BBSes and those of us outside the US remember paying per minute for connectivity and longing for that particularly foreign concept of free local calls
To have admitting that this applies to a certain privileged class but one that is growing mostly unfettered mostly untethered persistent net access is a New Thing
You can go on and on about what it's like to live with persistent networking and connectivity
I mean: isn't it interesting that and I hate to keep coming back to it but it's a handy point of cultural reference when someone loses network connectivity on the Enterprise it's more assumed that they're not actually on the Enterprise rather than the network having gone down? Because when the network's down you notice: everything stops working
There's not really spotty connectivity until the plot demands it - which is fair enough considering we're examining a 0s fictional TV universe
This thing about connectivity is interesting in the respect of the different types of network that the assumption of persistent connectivity provides
SMS didn't really care about presence and arguably was it a big missing feature that people were crying out for? It turned out that typical user behaviour and here I really am just reckoning was that people would have their phone with them all the time and the people who had a mobile phone and just turned it on to make calls - I'm looking at you Dad - were the ones who felt weird
The point of the phone was persistent connectivity
Marc Andreessen had a conversation on Twitter the other day on the difference between a pseudo-closed network like Secret where there are built-in design constraints that act against unimpeded network growth and open networks like Facebook or Twitter
Aside from appearing at least to look at the whole landscape in terms of a zero-sum vc investment ie: open always wins over closed so only pay attention to the winners without acknowledging that there might still be profitable and viable markets for the non-winners what feels to me to be somewhat obvious is that persistent connectivity supports multiple types of network graph
It feels like we're crossing over some sort of threshold where there's enough connectivity for enough people that interesting behaviours are starting to emerge
When you have the type of connectivity that enables teens to send around  figures worth of messages per day there's value in the global lookup type of network that everyone's on Facebook as well as ephemeral close-group networking Snapchat as well as pseudo-anonymous Secret
Where it all falls down of course is making money and producing sustainable services
Obvious disclaimer: Andreessen is a stupendously successful investor and I am just a guy
But anyway

At the same time all of this connectivity feels like it's an explosion of complexity that is a set of non-interoperable walled gardens and no way of providing a certain level of user control
Which makes me wonder about the possibility of the implementation of a layer of scripting like Applescript that at least in some way was easy to understand though arguably not easy enough to understand and write or something like If This Then That which effectively presents a sort of extra user interface on top of the entire internet
A lot of these apps and services are effective black boxes that I suspect people who do Learn To Code will get frustrated by
A computer can in principle do the things I need it to: so why can't it? Why wouldn't Facebook let me do this thing? Which is one of the reasons why knowing how all this stuff gets frustrating and complicated when explaining to people who don't understand: well yes in theory we can do this thing but we'd need to connect this bit to that bit and I guess Twitter could support animated gifs but it's not a question of code it's a question of them just not wanting to and so it turns out that humans are messy creatures and the big lesson everyone learns is that Computers Only Ever Do What We Tell Them To
So here's a question: what's the most impressive thing someone's made with something like Scratch?
I wrote yesterday in my bit about Fax Your GP which maybe not on its own but certainly appears to have contributed to this recent decision to push back rollout of the care
data database a little that with ever increasing emphasis on customer service and user experience the delta between what's good and what's intolerable inexorably decreases
That's to say: once you've seen something with a good user experience it's hard to justify other experiences in the same category having a shitty user experience
Sometimes this makes sense: you can pay a little more and pay Virgin America and get a super-good user experience when you fly compared to when you fly United and you're wondering why they're not paying you instead
That can kind of make sense when you're flying because you don't really have that many options
But in other cases where the goods or services are highly substitutable the distinction between one option which has a pleasurable service especially one rendered digitally and one that isn't is just going to lead to instances of nerd rage
A slightly more mellow than nerd rage case in point Russell Davies again on Sony's new product and the fact that while they're entirely capable of a singularly impressive engineering feat everything apart from shipping the product and making it falls down from a new customer's point of view
And that's despite the fun stuff you can do with it
And all of this in spite of the fact that you just know there's someone in management somewhere saying that they know a fifteen year old kid hopefully equally likely to be a girl than a boy who could 'knock up a website' that would do that in a few days
Nick Sweeney helped me articulate this in the context of government a little better in a series of emails:
If government can't produce a good digital user experience when other entities can then government looks bad
If government can produce a good digital user experience see: the work of GDS in the UK and then for some reason a good digital user experience isn't produced see: care
data opt-out then suspicion as to failure of implementation includes policy reasons ie malice as well as incompetence
So: companies and governments
You're on notice
It isn't hard to do this kind of thing
It isn't easy either
It's just simply doable
The fact that you're not doing it is now a valid signal that you're not doing it for a reason
Just a few minutes ago I learned that Irrational Studios of System Shock  and Bioshock fame was effectively closing down and being rebooted as a leaner 15-person-plus-Ken-Levine studio
The backdrop to this happening is interesting: I quipped on Twitter that one way of looking at this is in the context of the eternal war between the Triple A expensive 3D console tentpoles your Bruckheimer/Bay equivalents and smaller shops that produce work a bit like Telltale Games do with their critically acclaimed and by all accounts commercially successful Walking Dead series
What Levine is interested in sounds well interesting:
I've been working on a concept I call narrative LEGOs he said which is how do you take narrative and break it down
What are the smallest part of narrative that you can then remix and build something out of? Mix and match
What's even more striking is the comparison that many made when Bioshock Infinite came out to a game almost on the opposite side of the spectrum and with many even taking issue with whether it could be called a game in the first place: Portland OR based Fullbright Company's Gone Home
And last night watching a friend play The Stanley Parable which game's narration instantly reminded me of The Guide in The Hitch-Hiker's Guide To The Galaxy
Everything they say is being disrupted and eaten by code
But some of that disruption is more slight and well I would say insidious but let's just say longer lasting and less obvious
Videogames out of all media were bizarrely one of the arenas of culture that moved the slowest to embrace digital distribution with the major publishers clinging on to shipping boxed product
While the combination of digital distribution and massively available pocket consoles in the guise of phones made attacking the low-end easy it feels like it's only until recently have people started to cotton on to the fact that you can make Big Meaningful Story-based experiences to a reasonable read: profitable I think audience
So: here's the prediction and it's not a very insightful one I'm afraid
I think we've hit Peak Expensive D FPS AAA Story Game modulo things like Michael Abrash's dream of VR Within Five Years Yes Really I Mean It This Time
My money's on Levine experimenting with mobile and shipping fast
As a parting aside in this section: a metric crap-tonne of Measurable Attention Time used to be taken up by daytime TV and soaps
Those video games should see that as a stupendous opportunity but the business model behind it might need a bit of tweaking
Via the inestimable Matt Jones Scott Jensen on EasyHard problems particularly in the realm of home automation which inevitably touches upon the internet of things and deciphering the intent of us meat-based-water-bags
Jensen takes some time to remind us of Moravec's paradox: that it's bizarrely easy for us to make computers do what might appear to be intelligent tasks but are in fact ideally suited to being computationally brute forced by just walking rapidly and with purpose down every branch of every tree of a possibility space - e
g
solving Chess
Conversely it's super hard read: we haven't really done it yet for apparently easy tasks that we take for granted like oh I don't know recognising cats which takes a cluster at one of the largest private computing grids in the world or walking or spotting things or even understanding what it is that I'm saying
A lot of Jensen's examples are of the Do What I Mean Not What I Say problem which is probably part of the fault of the promises of perceptual and ubiquitous computing coming home to roost
Until you actually sit down and deconstruct all the dialogue that the actors have in conversation with the Computer on Star Trek: TNG which is a pretty good Tumblr project to be honest and parse all the meaning out and how phenomenally intelligent Majel Barret is it's hard to have a proper appreciation for the sheer amount of contextual awareness and cues that a home automation system needs to have
In a sense some people have been saying this about the nature of artificial intelligence itself: that it's hard or may even be impossible to create the new bar of what we raise to be artificial general intelligence without creating one that's embodied
And the same may be true for home automation or other types of intelligence
Part of this when we're still in the canyon of EasyHard is to have easy to understand transparent systems where you can understand why something has happened and how to either make it happen again or not
All of this is to say that repeatable expectable behaviour is one of the things that I'm assuming without having to go look for a citation is the kind of thing that reduces stress in humans as opposed to unpredictable random outcomes when you want your lights turned on
Here's a super short one
Why are we surprised that a generation of people who have been told in no uncertain terms Be careful what you post on the internet! It will live forever and haunt you! have flocked en masse to ephemeral conversation tools like Snapchat?
Bonus thought: Phil Gyford's insight that perhaps the nicest thing about SnapChat is its complete lack of archiving
Us old people have grown up with everything disappearing and upon the availability of digital media instinctively wanted to Save All The Things
But perhaps a more mature attitude is that some things can be saved and some things - well not so much
And I can see that not having to see the entire history of a conversation is freeing in a very interesting way
So here's an observation: if you promise that you'll get an episode of a newsletter out on what is for you effectively a holiday you're just going to spend most of the day stressed about it
So on Friday last week I probably shouldn't have said that I'd get one out today Presidents Day - my fifteen seconds of Googling is unclear about the requirement or placement of an apostrophe
And it turns out the mid-life parenting equivalent of recovering from a bender the night before and instead is recovering from a 2pm to 3pm open house first birthday party
The place is a mess a wreck and we're all incredibly tired and loud noises like say one year olds are - shall we say - piercing
So
Today's episode is both late and short
I mentioned the other day on Twitter that one of the things I've been vaguely working toward and that I know some of my friends have also been working toward in the grand scheme of Neal Stephenson Thinks He's Writing Books But He's Actually Writing Product Specifications Or In Some Cases If You String Them Together Business Plans has been The Young Lady's Illustrated Primer The Primer from his book The Diamond Age
If you haven't read The Diamond Age then you probably should right now etc
etc
The thing about a lot of descriptions of product in science fiction books or well any fiction I suppose is that in some instances they're quite clear and quite easy to imagine especially if you've aligned yourself with the right kind of writer
I don't necessarily mean the infodump Tom Clancy or let's be honest Neal Stephenson type of writer but there have always been some turns of phrase Heinlein's seminal the door irised open springs to mind or some constructions of atmosphere that have been just so required to bring a fictional product to life
With The Primer and it pains me that all my American readers are pronouncing it the way Jodie Foster does in Contact which again another movie you should etc
etc
 Stephenson's worldbuilding extends all the way through from a physical description of the design and manufacture of the product: its codename and its assembly the tools used in its design that did you notice? Provide direct haptic-driven feedback? And provide instant feedback in terms of prototyping? and the types of teams used in that design farming out the battery design for example through to its literal assembly in a D printer
And then: the supporting infrastructure where ultimately what Stephenson is describing is just a little bit like what some people might now call a MOOC because what he's been doing has been trying to get from one-off bespoke app a la Dave Morin through to the education-as-a-service system for well an entire country
The nice thing about doing these newsletters is that because I'm figuring things out as I literally type them the direct line between what Stephenson's been doing with The Primer into Education As A Service and something that's going to be Disrupted has never been so clear in my mind up until about fifteen seconds ago

Everything from cryptographically secure networks D printers stay-at-home second-job zero-hour workers like the Ractors and those who decide to take biological augmentation in order to get ahead in their jobs
There's something crackly about early Stephenson work like those two books Diamond Age and Snow Crash which just isn't in his later work and I wish there were something similarly well knitted-together
I would even forgive the Surprise! Stephenson! Endings!
Let me put it this way: practically all of the technology is there right now for the production of something like The Primer
What there isn't and there's always a catch isn't there is the business model
Which honestly must be easy to figure out
You've got: cheapish freeish tablets with network access
You've got cheapish educatedish labour in terms of a whole bunch of high-school educated people who are sitting at home with cheapish reliableish internet access
And uh you've got a broken education system
Honestly in a world where Amazon can practically give away tablets that are just about good enough and you can tap a button and instantly be connected to a hot redhead why can't we have The Primer?
Exactly
A long time ago some friends in the UK made something called Fax Your MP and I'm going to make up some of the history behind it because it's 0pm and it's easier for me to do that than actually look it up
The internet was supposed to be a great leveler - something that would connect us to each other and more importantly with those who represent us in government
It turned out that it didn't - at least it didn't in the UK in the mid to late 90s
In fact those who decided to try and email their MPs were met with a mixture of both disdain ie what kind of people use email in the mid to late 90s and ignorance emails were purposely treated I think as Not An Approved Method Of Correspondence
Instead to make sure that your voice was heard by your MP you could probably a write a letter already reduced to a self-selected set of angry green ink letter writers b go to a surgery further reduced to the set of people who don't have jobs don't have any green pens and do have an abundance of time or c by fax
Well there's a thing
Faxes are basically confused modems and if an unconfused modem can be plugged into a computer then the internet can talk to a computer that can pretend to be a confused modem and before you knew it there was a web-to-fax gateway that positively forced MPs to engage with their constituents
You can probably guess what happened next: some MPs protested that faxes sent via the service didn't count because well
Anyway
More recently there's news that the UK government is constructing a new centralised healthcare database
There are as the Fax Your GP site points out both good sides and bad sides to this but the one thing that everyone should be able to agree on is that the opt-out procedure is almost predictably bad: ie centrally the advice is that you should let your GP know and the precise methods are left up to the specific GP practice
Which is shall we say unclear and unhelpful to oh everyone
Hence Fax Your GP
A simple web to fax gateway that generates the opt-out documentation and faxes it to your GP
There is a point here
There is literally no excuse and here is where I break out my green ink for this type of service of infrastructure to not exist in this day and age
Where the UK's GDS is doing stellar work in bringing to life public services in a useful and accessible way it's a crying shame that volunteers have to step up to allow this sort of government interaction
In fact given quite how easily the Fax Your GP team have been able to bring up their service one is effectively forced to wonder if the lack of such a service was designed into the policy in the first place
All of which I'm sure helps engender trust in the leadership of the NHS in the first place
And so on one hand we have Flood Hack with the official backing of the Prime Minister and on the other hand we have Fax Your GP with no backing whatsoever and pointing out a rather insulting hole in the delivery of policy
Yes you're right
I'm angry
And this is just going to happen more
Because the more a government is unable to deliver basic services and apply its policy in a usable manner the more people are going to notice the cognitive dissonance every time their interaction with government is effectively reduced to this wonderful quote about a planning notice:
But look you found the notice didn't you
Yes said Arthur
Yes I did
It was on display in the bottom of a locked filing cabinet stuck in a disused lavatory with a sign on the door saying 'Beware of the Leopard'
Government bureaucracy has always been absurd
Hopefully that absurdity is just going to get more clear
Benedict Evans posted the other day that the number of Apple Computers-With-An-Asterisk ie iOS and OS X devices that support an application platform implicitly excluding the Apple TV hobby product sold surpassed the number of Microsoft Windows PCs sold globally in the fourth quarter of 014
The response and commentary on sites like Hacker News was a predictable case of completely missing the point: that for anyone who doesn't own a computer surprise: that's most of the entire world Apple Computers-With-An-Asterisk actually get the job done
And the job done is not necessarily one that requires general purpose computing in the sense that it's been deployed to the world through Microsoft's Computer On Every Desk vision
In a sense the competing vision that Apple instead promulgated was one of a Bicycle In Every Pocket
At the risk of harping on yet again about Jobs' insistence and somewhat tunnel vision focus of Apple being at the intersection of liberal arts and technology: perhaps that's yet another distinguishing factor between the two companies' application of technology
Microsoft a traditionally engineering heavy company can be seen as historically focussed on the well engineering side of things
MS-DOS and Windows PCs were complicated beasts capable of a great many number of things but they were machines that had to be harnessed
They were raw power with a bewildering set of options which options are naturally alluring to a great many number of people but they were not as focussed on from the user's point of view the Job To Be Done
And in the words of Sorkin-dramatising-Zuckerberg if you'd invented iMovie iPhoto or iTunes you'd have invented iMovie iPhoto or iTunes
And instead Windows get well Windows MovieMaker Windows Photo and Windows Media Player
Let me put it this way and I realise that this is more of a reiteration than a genuinely new insight
Tablets - in particular the iPad - are good enough now
A year ago at the traditional Thanksgiving technical support open house we replaced my in-laws aging laptops
For my father-in-law a new Windows laptop which I'll freely admit that even to myself remains somewhat impenetrable a situation I find amusing given I still remember building myself a Windows 000 Pro workstation while at college but for my mother-in-law an iPad
And it's been fantastic for her
It does everything she needs and she uses it more
That's the thing about the job to be done - another illustration of the cars-not-trucks argument that Jobs put forward to I think Mossberg at an All Things D conference
In our house for example we do not need a general purpose cooling machine that can take any configuration of things-to-be-cooled and cool them in any which way
Instead we have a fridge/freezer
The general-purpose PC in terms of form factor and use case is turning out to be but an aberration
The problem that the PC industry has found itself in is that it optimised itself into a local maxima: they optimised and optimised and optimised for the market that they thought they were in - which was People Who Buy PCs - and found themselves sitting atop a pretty mountain
And for the landscape they were in that was just fine
It's just that if you started looking in a different solution or possibility space there turned out to be a giant adjacent untapped maxima that we still haven't seen the ceiling of: and that's tablets and mobile
The job to be done turns out to be things like staying in touch or listening to music or looking at or sharing photos or playing a quick game: none of which require either being tethered to a desk or even on a couch with a laptop
It makes you think and hopefully without descending into Valley-esque dreams of capital D disruption what other local maxima have been entirely reliant upon heavy tethered processing
On Google's acquisition of Deep Mind Technologies yet another deep learning artificial intelligence startup one of the side notes of news was that the terms of the deal included the requirement that Google set up an A
I
ethics board
There's some good commentary on this and I have my suspicions or in this case hopes about what the terms of reference of the board might be
The board is not I don't think about the fact that Google has both a sometime military research contractor on board with the Boston Dynamics and their ATLAS BIGDOG and so-on platforms which honestly from someone with a somewhat naive point of view feel like they could be militarised rather easily and there are people worried about some sort of Terminator scenario
It's instead I think about the unintended consequences of deploying large-scale artificial intelligence algorithms out into the real world and how those algorithms and products might be deployed
With news that algorithmic prediction of revolution or protest is becoming increasingly accurate an ethics board at a build-fast-and-deploy company like Google and countless others including Facebook to look after those A/B tests of functionality and deployment of frankly opaque and smart-esque micro-products sounds bizarrely like a good thing to do and I find the feeling of siding with the formation of what amounts to a laboratory experiments academic ethics board by which proposals must pass unnerving to someone who wouldn't normally characterise themselves as either conservative or alarmist
I'm a big fan of Ellis's Global Frequency comics universe the idea of a select group of people around the world with Very Unique Skills deployed in interchangeable and substitutable combinations to deal with outside context problem and existential threats due to unintended outbreaks of the future that need to be mopped up
I would pay cash money for fiction that shows how we might deal with as Zeynep Tufekci hopefully I spelled her name right this time the new algorithmic nightmares that crop up
There might not be as many explodey things or biohorror but gosh aren't there enough things out there that would need dealing with
And I honestly have no idea how they might be dealt with
As an aside: the idea of Richard Feynman investigating Flash crashes or Stuxnet makes me simultaneously so excited I might explode and genuinely depressed at the fact that people always die
It's easier to write about bad things than it is to write about good things
Russell Davies reminded me about this the other day so here's me trying to well write about good things
Everyone loves a rant but well they're not always productive
So: here's a good thing
One of the things that I do really like about Nike's Fuelband is that they have achieved a certain simplicity with the red-to-green mechanic of showing how much activity you've achieved
For me that's one the victories in the whole quantified self movement and abstracting away from measured numbers into differently and more easily understood forms that allow for nuance
There's a whole bunch of other things I could say about the Fuelband but for once I'd like to draw attention to just the things that I like about it
Ian Betteridge of the eponymous Betteridge's Law has written about the practice of writing
I have to say that the discipline of sitting down and actually hammering something out on the keyboard has been hands down fantastic for me
I would not have been able to anticipate the reaction and I'd be lying if I said there wasn't some part of me that was doing this for validation or recognition but at the same time the fact that I can prove to myself that I have more than 00 words every week day of something interesting I feel I can explore has simultaneously been freeing and terrifying
It's still terrifying even after seventeen editions to deal with the fear that I'll literally have nothing interesting to say
But one of the things that I've learned about myself over the past ten years or so is that I do some of my best thinking out loud or through speech
And apparently through writing
I frequently don't know where I'm going when I start something in today's episode I think I'm most interested in where I ended up with the piece on Google's Ethics Board but I almost always end up somewhere that feels like I've unlocked something
It may not be something big or earth shattering but it is immensely satisfying
It might not work for everyone but I can heartily recommend something like it
And hopefully I'm getting better at writing with all of this practice
Bonus: even though it's terrifying it doesn't feel like work
I am quietly pleased
Growing up there were probably two people who were idols of mine: Richard Feynman ever since as a young boy a copy of Surely You're Joking Mr
Feynman had fallen into my possession and I had devoured it and Douglas Adams when a visiting uncle had left a dog-eared copy of The Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy behind for me
In a fantasy alternate universe solely existing in my head Feynman and Adams are a detective team who cruise around the world solving crime and explaining science
I'm sad that neither of them are alive anymore
I mention this because both of them had an uncanny knack of explaining and translating complicated concepts into something easily understandable
They did so with wonder and delight at the intricacy of the universe and even on the written page you there was a palpable sense of opportunity and potential
They were not by any measure the kind of people you would characterise as using science or reasoning to take away from the beauty of existence
It strikes me that there are so many complicated things in our world now that are out of the grasp of understanding never mind learning how to code or how technology is and always has been fundamentally shaping our culture and existence
We've never needed people capable of being able to look at systems interrogate them and present them in a human context in the way that Feynman was able to do for example with the Rogers Commission Report into the Challenger disaster
Adams in his own way was a particularly British kind of techno-utopian
One who could simultaneously see the absurdly sublime implications of computing with organisations like the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation but at the same time who could excite you about the potential of hypermedia in an inspiring documentary like Hyperland that again was far ahead of its time
We may not have software agents that are as explicit as those envisaged and imagined by Adams but they're behind the scenes ploughing through the clickstream of our intent and wandering through a web that isn't confined to desks anymore recommending movies and books booking our travel and connecting us with the rest of the planet in ways that we have never been able to do before
In a time of technological libertarianism in the belief of the depth of data that's being collected whether we like it or not either implicitly or explicitly it's people like James Bridle who are doing the work to bring to life what's hidden underneath the designed exteriors of the artefacts that we're interacting with each day in a way that is grounded in context for what we are: essentially and still hairless apes engineering increasingly complicated systems
We need more of them and for those of us who work in designing those systems that push and pull at the warp and weft of data and interactions where every touch leaves a trace we have a responsibility to make sure that what we do is understandable and accessible
Medium has an interesting reputation for being a repository of and if you'll forgive me the diving into slang whitesplaining mediumsplaning and general privilege reeking of better-than-thou from on high communication
If only wail the invariably male white educated and middle class designers and technocrats people would listen to me and implement my solution would the world be a better place and I would be able to operate my washing machine without calling my mother
Well Sturgeon's law applies on Medium as well as anywhere else which means that for the purposes of this I'm letting you know that I took the time to read Zeynep Tufecki's essay about the nature of the internet and surveillance in the twenty first century and what it means for us
Tufecki has simply strongly clarified why the current state of big data and drawing algorithmic inferences from the morass of data we create each day can't easily be compared to 984 or the Panopticon
Because this is a future that we have chosen for ourselves where we do indeed have freedom and happiness although tied to consumption and that ultimately Certain Inalienable Rights have more or less modulo as Tufecki points out if you're poor or non-white or female have been recognised as Inalienable and are slowly but surely spreading out through society
The risk and danger is in what we can't see and in the implication of the data that does surround us
All of it can be used more easily than ever before and it can be as right or as wrong as you need it to be
Much of it is unknown and in the service of objectives that are either opaque to us or blindingly obvious
In any case the reduction of people to data a construct with variables and rows in a database lazily linked with a JOIN to countless others raises questions about what we want to achieve with all of this and whether we want to achieve that in the first place
Tefucki says that we need to update our nightmares
As ever they are both more mundane brands like Target wanting to ensnare us in their shopping embrace as we approach parenthood and simultaneously more sinister the potential micro-manipulation of voter messages as a high-tech version of jerrymandering
In a way you can see the data in the cloud around us as a set of field lines that can be massaged to points forcing toward certain directions or away from others
The Unix philosophy of many pieces loosely joined has been extended to our selves as simulacra and models are created from our detritus
So this is the deal: Tefucki says to the question Is the Internet good or bad: Yes
It is
As it has ever been it is a tool that has wrought massive genuine democratic change because it has connected people to people
And the result of connecting people to people now that we have spammed the planet with our Turing machines and their infinite tape is that we have written ourselves onto that infinite tape without realising who can read it and what they might do with it
Yesterday's episode included some scribblings about the Quantified Self Felton's Reporter and Nike's Year In Nike Fuel
I was reading Fathom's post about the thinking behind the Year In Nike Fuel and was again struck and a bit saddened by the tone and manner of presentation of what ultimately is intensely personal data about your daily movements
The post itself is the interesting thing: talking about gym rats mountaineers working dads city slickers and how they all have distinct patterns
Or how the Fuel activity of a newborn baby looks
But the output - so cold! Pure data! Red and blues and ultimately a dashboard that looks like it's trying to emulate a Boeing Dreamliner glass cockpit
All of that emotionally loaded meaningful personal data gets reduced to vigorous exercise or moderate exercise or inactive
The half marathons get turned into highest weekday peak
Workouts get reduced to
0 per week and weekly exercise gets turned into 4h 4m which is moderate
Bullshit I say
I mean look at this from that Fathom post:
￼
Those are different shapes
But preoccupation with all of this data and showing the actual numbers and man the obsession with the Quantified part of the Quantified Self and the fixation that that must mean numbers
You know what those charts look like? They look like they were designed to be read by computers
They look like things that computer vision algorithms could have a field day with
But the data was gathered by sensors in the first place! Those charts are ostensibly for humans and yet the aesthetic is almost as if they're trying to look like a fictional-future in-HUD display for the Terminator
Those charts are what a science fiction movie would show when getting us to understand what a robot saw when it looked at a person
I was instantly reminded of how much character there was in the Dopplr annual report
That dream team of Biddulph/Jones/Insam produced not only a product that was ahead of its time but had a phenomenally meaningful annual report
Their example for Barack Obama:
￼
is brimming with context that helps make the quantified part of data understandable and relatable on a human level
As an aside you would see more work like this in terms of design making data understandable through work like HowBigReally which is still amazing for helping me realise that either the moon is tiny or Australia is massive and Schooloscope with its Chernoff faces
We're not wired to understand bar charts
We're wired to understand other things
That's not to say that there isn't work that can be done to make bar charts and pie charts and graphs and sparklines and so on more understandable
But they're not the only way of representing data and holy shit did you know we have computers now? That make things like saying Your personal velocity for 008 was 38
10 km/h which is about the same as a six-lined race runner lizard significantly easier! And Christ they were doing this back in 2008
That was five years ago merely a year after Flickr came out
It is honestly disappointing to me that we are collecting more data than ever that means more to people than ever before and still obfuscating it
It makes me upset about what we've lost and how far behind we are
Try fucking harder people
It's not just a case of throwing Processing at something
It's almost as if the tech industry has a reputation for being severely lacking in empathy with actual people for fuck's sake
Tom Armitage who is a stupendously smart person has made a Thing which he's finally made public and that he forgot he showed me over the Thanksgiving break which for everyone else in the world was around the end of November
His Thing was Infinifriends which is essentially the fucking genius realisation that a all the Friends scripts have been transcribed onto the internet b you can get amusing uncanny-valley programmatic animation with algorithm induced emotion from things like Plotagon or xtranormal which doesn't even exist anymore which are essentially fancy text-to-speech engines with probably Unity-powered D animation on the back and c Markov chains because hey you throw Markov chains at everything these days
Markov chains are the new Bayesian filters didn't you know?
Anyway
You end up with infinite episodes of Friends
And they are wonderful just perfect to my absurdist mind
They make no sense and that's why they're funny
And they play off the Friends universe so you have this super interesting juxtaposition of terrible nonsensical writing and bad computer generated acting colliding in your head with the mannerisms of the real actors on the real sets backed by a writer's room
At some point these are going to be spat out to YouTube and then people are going to freak out because algorithmically generated drama is going to be 'good enough' in the same way that people thought people would never watch movies on a
5in diagonal phone screen and hey it turns out that people will
And because this is how the world works now expect generalised infini-engines for pretty much any syndicated TV show
OR OR: and I'm looking at you Mr
Ellis now that Marvel has a fucking universe API algorithmically generated Marvel Universe comics
So a couple of things that actually prompt a reckon about Apple and televisions as opposed to the usual breathless wanking over them shipping an integrated display or whatnot
Item the first: a new Apple TV hardware identifier has been found in developer iOS  bundles with a bump in major version ie AppleTV 32 -> Apple TV 41
Item the second: A new Beatles?! channel on Apple TV has been released to celebrate the 0th Anniversary of uh the Beatles' debut in America
The first thing if true is a pretty solid signal of some new hardware
The second one is a weak signal because Oh My God if you've got an Apple TV is that thing a fucking mess right now
Apple's list of what's available on the product right now is a long scrolly scrolly thing and the fact that the only way to get rid of stuff you don't want to watch for example KOR TV isn't so useful in our household because of our inability to understand Korean is protip to use Parental Controls and hide certain apps/channels
And they're not really Apps
But they're kind of Channels
But not always Channels
It's confusing
Also: no kids mode! Apart from the weird Parental Controls!
It's almost as if the profusion of content that's available for the Apple TV and it's not really a profusion more of a gentle dripping to be honest and compared to competing platforms like the Roku is going to force Apple to a refresh the hardware so it's capable of a bit more customization the current models ship with GB of flash storage mostly for cacheing video and b refresh the hardware so it's capable of doing a little bit more than essentially acting as big-screen an XML frontend to network available video - Bluetooth game controller support or no no one's going to be installing 1080p games even if they're the now unavailable Flappy Bird on an 8GB Apple TV
Nick Felton released his newest thing Reporter a Quantified Self app for iOS
Also Nike released its 013 Year In Nike Fuel visualization website both of which ultimately provoke my sense of frustration at all of this Quantified Self stuff being a bit cold and inhuman when even the moniker which the movement goes by seems to strip any emotion out of the fact that people are doing stuff
I absolutely yearn to see some bringing to life of data around the quantified self and personal health that doesn't just reduce stuff to a bunch of numbers displayed in different colours or bar graphs
I have a suspicion about the gender split for say Nike Fuelband customers versus Fitbit/Jawbone customers but I have to say that I don't think anyone is making any of this stuff in a friendly way that would open up the market to people other than data-driven numbers-tracking geeks
Like me
While writing this I received my 013 prescription records from Walgreens and thought it a bit weird that a pharmacy chain would be jumping on the whole Year In Review Visualized bandwagon with my assortment of medication but upon opening up the email it turned out to be for my tax records
America!
Speaking of numbers I briefly flirted with the stats tracking of unsubscribe/subscribe notifications on Tinyletter over the weekend and had to turn it off because it was like a random reinforcement shot to my sense of self-worth
It turns out that in my head one unsubscribe needs at least twenty subscriptions to feel like things are in balance for my ego
So I turned that off pretty sharpish

I had my first Sad Algorithm moment that not-quite uncanny valley of algorithmically induced emotion that happens when a notification system designed to be helpful in fact does nothing of the sort
Personally it was more painful perhaps because it was timely than seeing a birthday reminder for a dead friend on Facebook or a work anniversary for a dead friend on LinkedIn
My mother-in-law whom I adore and have known for the last eleven years of my life made the decision the other day that she was too ill to come out and visit for my son's first birthday
This round of chemo unfortunately doesn't look like it's working
As someone who grew up in another country from his grandparents I didn't realise how important it is to me for my son to get to know and regularly see his own grandparents
That my wife's family are now unable to come out hit me in a way I didn't expect
So when I got a Google Now notification that a certain SouthWest Airlines flight had been delayed after the first split second of bemusement I realised that I was being told about the flight they would've been on
I don't know what the answer to this is
If my in-laws had told us by email instead of via a phone call would Google Now have been smart enough to parse out the cancellation? In a purely utilitarian calculation I can see that Google would prefer to send notifications than not: that's where the usefulness comes in
And for Google to know that my parents had cancelled their trip - there's no UI for me to tell at least not that I saw Google to not remind me
Would they need perfect information about my life to know what to interrupt me with and what to remind me about and what to hold back on? Should the burden have fallen on my in-laws to let Google know to not remind me?
This is probably just another prompt to watch Charlie's Brooker's excellent Black Mirror
I found it so much easier to get into Threes which I've described to friends as Drop  on crack than Flappy Bird if only because Flappy Bird just seemed so transparent
I see exactly what you're trying to do there Mr
Flappy and I refuse to participate
Whereas the simple pleasure of getting multiples of 3 to match up flicks some sort of switch in my brain that I can't get around
Ian Bogost has written the definitive If You Read One Thing About Flappy Bird You Should Read This article; I think it captures perfectly what's so interesting about it and speaks to our relationship with games of that particularly singular genre
Plus it's super accessible if you know nothing about games
I hate Ian Bogost he's so smart
Oh and Secret which a has stupidly poor web SEO try searching for secret iphone app b stupidly poor iTunes App Store SEO what doesn't and c has me engaged in some weird car crash type fascination of trying to figure which of my 0! 31! friends are on it and watching uh Ben Ward's party
On the one hand it's interesting to see what my friends will say when I don't know which of them they are on the other hand most of the stuff I'm seeing from friends-of-friends or that has been deemed viral and spread is pretty shlocky hallmarky stuff or apparently about what seems to be the quite frankly excessive amount of oral sex young people ar having these days
So if Twitter replies were any indication the geek date that Matt Haughey and I took to the Portland International Auto Show where we were seduced by the BMW i caught the attention of a few people who wanted to know why exactly we liked it so much
So here's a non-video text-only geek-point-of-view version of Top Gear where I give my reckons about the i3:
- You know in those cars where you have to pull down a front seat to get into the back row? And how you can never find the handle? And you end up hunched over contorted into a shape that normally you'd have to pay someone to persuade you to get into scrabbling for a handle or a clasp or something anything that will mean that you'll stop thinking about the fact that you're pointing your arse out into the world? You don't get that with these cars because the handle's in the headrest
It's right there! Honestly it feels like now I'm 4 and a dad I'm entirely all too easily impressed by something that means I don't have to bend over
- I touched on this a little in the last episode but it really was refreshing to see something that wasn't a traditional car console design
There were little swoopy bits and in a break with tradition I'm actually going to embed an image made out of that sustainable bamboo and again being impressed by just a different texture that wasn't goddamn stitched leather for once
In other cars they would've just stuck a crap fake mini iPad in the central console that would've irritated you but in the i a the screen wasn't the normal 4:3 ratio that you normally see and instead some weird elongated more-than-16:9 which combined with the sweeping bamboo already made me feel a bit like I was Worf standing at the curvy bit of the Enterprise-D behind Riker Troi and Picard; b it was floating and not embedded in the console itself and fuck me if the most impressive thing about car design is the fact that the central multifunction display isn't embedded in the console itself
Do you see what I mean about the industry needing some capital D disruption?
￼
The OS of the car appeared to be BMW iDrive
2 which is I guess the newest version? It has a 200GB hard drive and 3D graphicsand an iPod-esque vertical/horizontal menu navigation mechanic
There's a lot of what feels like extraneous swooshing going on with the curves on the left hand side which makes the UI look more like something you'd see in Mass Effect than in a real life car you could be driving right now
The doors open in a weird way which already makes you kind of endeared to it
It had a ridiculously small turning circle which impressed us as we circled around a potted plant
Apropos of nothing there was a context-free sign hanging in the BMW i area that just said: URBANIZATION which sign Matt and I found hilarious
￼
If anything it was also the sales patter that Matt and I found endearing
It genueinly did feel like we were being sold on a car that had been designed for the city and one ground-up at that
The drive was pleasant at a screaming 7 miles an hour and to be honest I spent more time than I should've geeking out over the touchpad in the iDrive controller and spelling out m-e-t-a-f-i-l-t-e-r in the web browser before we were reminded that there was a line of people waiting to get into the car
There's a lot that's already been said about the UK government's support of 014 as the Year of Code ably so by Adrian Short
So I thought I'd add to the noise
As a precocious little snot of a kid I loved messing around with the BBC Micros that we had at school
My parents being academics borrowed computers home from work any chance they had so I wasn't really afraid of the box and the monitor in the corner
For a few years at the beginning of the 90s computing lessons for 11-13 year olds were about plugging breakout boxes into those BBCs and trying to get robots to do things by writing BASIC programs for them
And then the school got a bunch of money for becoming a Technology College bought a bunch of PCs at the time Elonex boot-from-network 486SX pizza boxes and computing became not well learning how to do computing but a vocational thing: here's how you use Microsoft Excel or Word
And that was where the shift was I think
When Lottie Dexter talks on her Newsnight interview about being able to code being a vital part of first understanding and then functioning in the world that we now live in we're never really given the chance to unpack what that means before the Paxman is unleashed on her and she wanders into loosely joined words
Similarly the video package put together of kids learning how to code is from the point of view of someone who knows how to code not exactly well helpful
I'm all for teaching people how computers work and giving people - and from a young age children - the ability to explore that understanding
And I'm not entirely sure if I buy off on Adrian Short's neoliberal agenda that the Year of Code is the thin end of an axe driving a work and employment agenda
But nonetheless there is something that again smacks of trying to implant code into people as if it were some sort of didactic skill that could be introduced and reinforced in the same way factory style
Ah factory style
And now we're into the whole model of education in the UK anyway the way that our classrooms were built and curricula established to serve a very particular need of providing bodies for a rapidly industrialising nation
At the same time I don't know what to feel about friends who are pulling their children out of formal schooling and are instead home schooling
The idea as it's presented and as the rhetoric comes across of being able to teach people to code in a year is about as interesting as teaching a whole nation Japanese or Chinese in a year
And yes I do see the insight in code being potentially a more valuable language in terms of employment or earnings opportunity than German
But here are some things about what living in a world run on code means
It means that we create a finance system backed by interdependent systems that we as human beings are increasingly unable tease apart and understand as a whole if we have ever in fact been able to understand such systems
Knowing code ultimately means training a country's worth of new mini Snowdens whom conceptually are able to understand how to manipulate large amounts of information effortlessly
Knowing code is more about knowing the end result that you want to achieve and the abstracted steps that you need to take to achieve that end goal
And then you get to teach jQuery
But knowing code won't get you a job
The ten year old interviewed thinks she needs code to work in a bank so she can create her own website
Honestly one vision of the future we had was that she would know enough code in her banking job to automate most of the work she has to do
And then what? Code is a means of expression
Or as Microsoft's new CEO would put it the best code is poetry
The point of code isn't just to get you a job
What's the video-on-demand equivalent of Google getting better at design faster than Apple's getting better at software? The perception is that Netflix is killing it in the original content space: series like Orange is the New Black are picking up award nominations and their list of original series isn't anemic
You'll note though that I didn't include House of Cards and that's mainly because as a a Brit and b someone who's seen the original House of Cards doesn't count in my mind as a new Netflix commission
It's not that original
In contrast my anecdata of one-comment-from-a-friend is pointing me in the suspicious direction of Amazon not really knowing what they're doing with their original content the new Chris Carter series The After is apparently terrible and uh who else is commissioning content that's skipping broadcast or cable?
I don't understand what it is that's preventing iRobot and their Roombas from taking over the world
Young people these days they'd love an autonomous robot vacuum that they could control with their iPhone
And they live in tiny flats or apartments now with no stairs
What's happening? In fact you wouldn't even need to sell them the Roomba
Just rent it to them for about $5 a month
Of course it could just be that manual labour is cheaper and more effective but that's never stopped anyone from doing upselling
Or downselling
I don't know
So Upworthy's in the news for talking about a new 'attention metric' instead of pageviews/impressions/eyeballs/brain implants
Essentially what it looks like they're trying to do is capitalise upon the fact that people spend a lot of time on Upworthy's site and that their content performs quite well
An engaged audience is of course better value for an advertiser than an unengaged audience no?
Ha! Let this be another part in the continuing series of Let me tell you the things I have learned from my journey in advertising!
Dirty secret: advertisers read: brands not agencies might not want attention in the first place
Or at least not the kind of attention that Upworthy is selling
When I first moved over to agency side nearly four years ago gamification was but the twinkle in a huckster's eye and nothing near the multi-billion dollar world-powering capitalism engine that it is now in 014 as promised by the huckster's twinkle
And the thing that I was and still am excited about was the whole notion of Games as a Creative Medium and battling the stereotypical view that games were for 15 year old boys in their parents' basements who liked to shoot things in the face
And that at the time Zynga looked like they were going to take over the world ha! and everyone who was anyone was busy building farms in Farmville
And we all know how that turned out: now we're all impressing each other with our Flappy Bird scores
Anyway
As an outsider I had thought that the thing advertisers read: brands would care about would be engagement - the amount of time that people spend doing something which means you have longer time for your message to get across and to sink in
Turns out engagement? Not so much
Reach and frequency which games do kind of are instead the kinds of things that traditional advertisers care about more and bear in mind that I'm grossly generalising here
Nowhere is this more apparent in the land of advertising that is comfortable with buying television advertising to achieve its goal where I learned about things like TRPs in terms of firing your message out into the literal electromagnetic ether to have it land on your ideal audience's retina
The thing about this is that - and all this is caveated from my point of view - the mechanism of advertising is still more or less predicated upon that formula of reach and frequency and not further down the stack of effectiveness
If all I care about is reach how many people might see my message or 0 second spot and frequency how often people will see my 30 second spot I really really don't care about buying engagement
Because let's face it: if engagement really was what clients read: brands wanted then well the ecosytem of ads that we see would probably look a bit different and more like well Upworthy headlines
I rapidly learned that what I thought would be a great thing to sell check out how much engagement I can generate for you using this game! Look how effectively I can convey your complex message! wasn't actually always what a client wanted in the first place or even was a sufficiently alien way of achieving a client's goal that I just unlocked a whole Pandora's box one example: so how do we get people to engage in this method of higher engagement? We have to advertise it to them? Well why don't we just advertise the thing that we want to advertise in the first place?
Upworthy are going to have an interesting job ahead of them in terms of what they're trying to prove with their engagement metric and whether it actually matters to the people they think it matters to: those buying their ad inventory
One of my friends tweeted the phrase Nationalise Twitter the other day and in an example of what I would previously describe as the embarrassing way that my brain works caused me to start thinking aloud about who exactly runs all the computing infrastructure in the Next Generation universe of Star Trek
I mean pretty much all the Federation computers that we see civilian or Starfleet all run LCARS operating system which on reflection is some sort of horrible dystopic flat design future where everything likes to be orange and the voice interface has about as much personality as an extremely focussed and un-chatty Google voice search
In fact the computing infrastructure of the 4th century is so bizarre and alien and backward looking compared to the current day that I really would pay someone money to show me something that's genuinely new
I mean: do Ferengis sell ships that come with in-app purchases to upgrade the warp core efficiency? What is it with members of Starfleet that they don't title their personal Holonovels as Riker Risa Fantasy Scenario BDSM Final Final This One Really but instead Riker Scenario One? And does Riker make Riker Scenario One publicly available and is there a five star rating system? When you want to fly a ship from a PADD do you download an app? Does Starfleet have a centrally provisioned app store? If a Federation citizen on the Manzar colony writes a piece of fiction is there even a place where someone on Caldik Prime can download it?
And then even things like this: who administers and runs all of this infrastructure? Is there someone in Starfleet Engineering who says Computer upgrade all PADDs to LCARS OS 214
3810? What if the end-users don't want their PADDs with a new operating system? What if I preferred the music player from LCARS OS 9214
3809? Is LCARS open source? It kind of feels like it should be
Can a Federation civilian upload a patch? Does the Federation administer infrastructure and not Starfleet? Or as one of my friends commented does Star Fleet only have one mainframe some cloud planet somewhere inevitably? And if LCARS is open source does that mean the Klingons can just fork it on github? Is there even a github?
None of this makes sense! It all falls down!
So I got this DM on Twitter the other day: Hey interested in hitting the Portland Auto Show to mock/laugh/be appalled at new car UIs?
If that sounds like a geek date then you're me and Matt Haughey and you did indeed go to the Portland Auto Show to mock laugh and be appalled at new car UIs
And they were mostly appalling - and I mean really really appalling - and there were a number of interesting things that jumped out at us
One was: man the people who design D-pads in cars especially on the steering wheel really could do with taking inspiration from people who actually know how to make D-pads namely Microsoft Sony and Nintendo
Probably less Nintendo these days though
Another was: car companies have all but given up
It feels like you could gather a bunch of designers and if you really really wanted to a few people who knew how to build a car or how cars are built take a stroll down Sand Hill road and say You know what? Cars are stuck in the 0s
The software is terrible
People have iPads
This is ripe for
disruption! come out with a cheque for a few million dollars and then Inevitably Disrupt The Auto Industry
Or do what Tivo did and just kind of limp on and fail to disrupt anything because of entrenched interests
Let me put it this way
Every car had an LCD in it but none of them - not even the few concept cars we saw - had retina class displays
And you're sitting even further away from the displays than when you're using a phone or probably even a tablet
Volkswagen had cars with a low-res dot matrix LCD display where you could actually see individual monochrome pixels
Most cars still had CD player slots for actual CDs for playing actual music
We learned a quick rule: a car is for Young People if when you get in the driver or front passenger seat you can instantly see AUX IN or a USB charger port
A car is for Old People if well you can't
Leather stitching hilariously seemed to be a trend to the extent that at one point we thought we'd found Scott Forstall's car You should see back here! There's a backgammon set on some green felt!
There was one wonderful example of skeuomorphic design in a luxury Ram truck that had gorgeous leather and in the back seats a non-functioning buckle the fastener used magnets on a leather pocket
No cars had flat design
Cars for Young People also looked like they were trying to have an iPad in the central dash but obviously did not actually have iPads in the central dash
The most striking example of this was when we got to have a go in a BMW i and by have a go I mean be driven in a BMW i3 because of safety reasons and the central not-an-iPad was just floating there on a stalk and the rest of the dash was made of sustainable bamboo
The version of Sync by Microsoft as conspicuous in its branding as an Intel Inside sticker that we saw on some Ford cars felt interestingly to be practically not Microsoft-y at all
I mean definitely not Metro-y definitely not prehistoric Windows Phone and definitely not well anything else
It's interesting
Cars are a whole area of consumer electronics - just like A/V receivers - where the software still appears to be locked in the mid 0s
There was one particular display that we saw that I swear looked just like it had been laid out like a Windows 3
1 application
You could tell the manufacturers that had actually put in effort because they didn't just have giant screens in the central dash with buttons like NAV and TEL and >> and << and RESET bookending the screen on the left and right
They might as well have just used the HAL 9000 text and labelled the buttons COM GDE NAV and ATM
Also: web browsers in cars
Because: why not?
One of the most refreshing conversations we had was with the dealer rep who drove us around in the BMW i
He explained that people like us were a dying breed and that young people these days weren't interested in cars
Cars were as Matt pointed out just large iPhone docks
BMW rep said that the company that made Ultimate Driving Machines was on its way out and it had created the i Division to solve the problem of providing mobility to urban young professionals who really like sustainable bamboo finishings and that unlike something like the Nissan LEAF the i3 had been created ground up as a new type of vehicle for a new type of market
It still used the same iDrive software as other BMW cars though
So: things I would go down to Sand Hill Road and ask for millions of dollars now include a humane quantified self devices b car software and c a/v receivers
Fair warning: this one definitely is rambling
I get quite tired of the whole 'you've got to be a maker' rhetoric sometimes
If anything because the rhetoric is frequently used in a zero-sum environment: if you're not moving fast and making things then you're doing things wrong
In a surprising development people who work in a universe derived from the binary like to think of things in binaries with rules and heuristics
This is what I like about the space I have here: because I'm not trolling for page views or writing a little bit on Medium that feels like it needs to attract traffic or attention I have you guys! You guys who've chosen to receive this stuff! I don't have to be needlessly inflammatory and say something like The Cult Of Making Things And Why It Needs To Die and mediumsplain to you
Or because this isn't Twitter I don't have to have the argument or advance my position in increments of 40 characters that ultimately need to be collected by someone else in a collection of Exquisite Tweets
So here's my reasonable position: yes you need a practice in making things
It's only by doing things and seeing the feedback that you can get better
But at some times the if you're not a maker you're roadkill mentality is exclusionary: that the binary nature of discussion and advancement of points devalue well people who think about things and -- you can guess where this is going -- don't code or don't want to
A long time ago I learned to code: I've always been a geek and like a lot of people spent ages laboriously typing out programme listing into a BBC
I like systems
I like seeing how things fit together and in a kind of Unix-y way like seeing how I can join things together
If we take this thing and then pipe it into that thing and those two things are kind of unrelated then wow: we could make a new thing
I spent awkward teenage years poring over copies of BYTE magazine and thinking: man Jerry Pournelle must be really lucky to get all this stuff and his house sounds awesome
I would circle those information cards that fell out of the magazines and would get mailed To me! At my house! brand new brochures about the NeXTStation
Of which literature I would probably scan in for Internet Points now but for my parents throwing all the stuff out
I would spend one summer with a schoolfriend setting up all of our school's Windows 5 computers with TCP/IP and hacking together an intranet running on IIS
Or munging a coursework submission system together in Perl
But at the same time: man I loved writing
I still do I think
Otherwise probably I wouldn't be doing this and I wouldn't have started blogging way back in '99 either
So code
I know enough to be dangerous
I know enough about the concepts - ish and when I finally had some spare time I went off and got a bit of paper that said I knew what I was talking about and for my dissertation wrote a Mac OS X program that would generate a bit of Friend-of-a-Friend RDF for you using another piece of hacked-together Cocoa/Java bridge which doesn't even exist any more
And also because I think I wasn't allowed to do the thing in Objective-C which I hadn't even learned anyway
All this is kind of a tangent: it may well be my own neuroses and issues but there's a part of me that feels on some level some sort of resentment at not being a Maker
And I can point to any number of issues about why that might not be the case - when you're clinically depressed and see something that you Capital S Should be able to do like order an arduino and start messing about with it because intellectually you're capable of doing it but you Just Don't because you're clinically depressed well
- but part of what I'm trying to figure out is being comfortable with myself
What I'm starting to figure out is that actually I quite like being in the middle
I like being able to talk to and understand the people on the business end of writing the code that makes software
But I also like being removed enough from it that I feel like I can see some sort of big picture
There's value in making things that aren't underpinned by code
There's value in creating understanding or even in manufacturing understanding if that helps
Hell there's even value in making Keynote decks especially because there's value in making good ones - and are you saying that there's more value in bad software than there is in bad Powerpoint? Because that feels like the kind of argument that is a waste of time
Of course no one's saying that if all you're doing is wanking around just reckoning things and not moving toward 'making' something that's not exactly productive
But - and I honestly don't think this is the kind of slippery slope that moral relativism falls down where anything goes - even the right kind of provocative opinion hat tipped to Mr
Anil Dash can be productive in opening up an Overton window
I guess what I'm railing against is this: if you're the kind of person who values someone else's worth on whether they make things and you're the kind of person who considers making to be something where you squirt code in one end and a Thing comes out the other end then we're probably not going to be friends
Because you sound like an inflexible idiot
Because this newsletter is something I make
So there
I still like this poster though
Yesterday in the continuing series of artist-in-medium-disrupted-and-disintermediated-by-internet-demands-something Jean Michel Jarre was the latest to advocate some sort of device tax this time on smartphones for the fact that digitisation and digital distribution fundamentally changed the landscape of recording music:
“We should never forget that in the smartphone the smart part is us creators
If you get rid of music images videos words and literature from the smartphone you just have a simple phone that would be worth $0
Okay let’s accept that there’s a lot of innovation in the smartphone so let’s add $100 for this innovation – the remaining $300-$400 of the price should go to [the creators]
”
Now I don't want to go shooting fish in a barrel
And imagining Steve Jobs' reaction to the proposition that Apple's innovation in the iPhone is $00 is amusing in my head
But perhaps Mr
Jarre should let us know what the rest of his reckons about the value of innovations are:
The LTE patents that underpin mobile data access
Let's make that $0
The Gorilla glass used on smartphones
Maybe only $ for that
Because really it's only glass but stronger
Wavelength division multiplexing in fiber optic backhaul networks? Oh go on
$3
The other blindspot and actually this is starting to feel rather mean of Jarre's position is his looking at the smartphone purely as a distribution platform for dumb content
There is no mention as mentioned by @sir_eccles of the Angry Birds Candy Crushes Clash of Clans Temple Runs or Tiny Towers that are interactive media not music images videos words and literature and making a tidy sum of money by well monetising the experience
And what of the other manufacturers of every single item from this 991 Radio Shack ad? Were they not also the lifeblood of a country deserving of compensation from the reckless disruption caused by the smartphone?
And anyway: it would've been nice if The Guardian had done the maths on Jarre's claim if only to point out how stupendously unreasonable and insane it was
Now: Wikipedia reckons that on its fifth birthday Apple had sold 50 million iPhones
That was in the middle of 2012 so we know those numbers are lowballed
It's actually more like half a billion iPhones now
Which is insane
At Jarre's low end of $300 he reckons that One Hundred And Fifty Billion Dollars of iPhone revenue - and that's just iPhone revenue! Not even touching any of Samsung's! - should have been redistributed presumably via licensing agencies to people who make music images video words and literature
He's on crack
About a hundred and fifty billion dollars worth of crack
And anyway if we're really checking Wikipedia also reckons that as of Q 2013 1082mm Android phones have been sold
So that's another $324 billion
So altogether by Jarre's count the tech industry owes his content creator friends at least half a trillion dollars of back-pay
Because in comparison Wikipedia reckons that between 005 and 2012 the global music industry's revenue decreased by about $4bn from $20
7bn to $16
5bn
So someone please stop Jean Michel Jarre from reckoning
Because he's reckoning recklessly in his capacity as president of CISAC - the global body of authors' societies
That said I suppose we should remember that Jarre is presumably using Music Industry Mathematics - potentially related to bistromathics - where an individual song is worth over $0000
It feels like there was a fork in the road a few years back somewhere between say ten and five years ago where one bunch of people building stuff gravitated around the word friend and another bunch of people gravitated around the word follower
And then poof ten years later we have Facebook and Twitter and Instagram and Snapchat and Google Plus and and and
Words mean things
Okay that's a cheating sentence a trite one but hear me out
A lot of the criticism that Facebook gets - and if you want [citation needed] you're not going to get one because my day job is increasingly being taken up by thinking about Facebook - is around the whole Friend thing
The fact that people have around 50-300 Facebook friends but what they do is that they put square quotes around the word like I just did because they're differentiating from a friend friend and a Facebook friend
With that Friendiness though comes the baggage and the connotations and the intent that correspondingly doesn't come with a word like Follower
And if you're the kind of person who's been keeping up with the work of people like danah boyd over the years or you're the kind of person who knows that the Microsoft Social Computing Symposium happens then none of this is going to be news
But it's fascinating coming back to it and seeing it happen on such a large scale affecting so many people
Because this is my newsletter I get to just reckon all over the place: people don't like to think that an algorithm is interfering however benevolently! in a relationship they have with a friend - even if that friend may only be a Facebook friend! The word counts
However an algorithm can in a way interfere all it wants with someone I'm following because you're describing what almost feels like an algorithmic relationship to begin with
There's a mapping without the baggage of friendship in the word following
Being a friend comes with so many social obligations and minutiae of etiquette that you may not feel like you want an algorithmically mediated friendship - even if that algorithm is transparent and understandable good luck with the latter in this day and age
In contrast the algorithm that mediates a follower relationship is simple and feels like it should be transparent and understandable: X follows Y X sees all that Y sends
There shouldn't be an obfuscation stage in a follower relationship and one isn't expected
On the one hand it feels like there's the technocratic belief that the algorithm can solve all that's interesting here when we talk about navigating relationships that are bucketed under the word 'friend'
On the other if I'm being uncharitable it feels like growth-hackers are glomming on to the word 'friend' as a way to ensure that their startup spreads and goes viral
Kevin Slavin's tumblr has a fantastic nugget of a thought on the word and how it's being used in the new explosion of mobile/social/communications apps like secret and whisper - I particularly like this quote: a halfass compromise between anonymity and conventional social graphs
The wonderful thing about something like chatroulette was that it connected you in a very easy to understand way to a mass of humanity where they didn't even have to use that damned word
Slavin's right: anonymity and the gap between it and the conventional social graph is a stupendously rich one that can be explored and is explored in products ugh I hate that word like Tumblr without having to deal with all the friend baggage
If you haven't read Snapchat's CEO's AXS Partner Summit Keynote then let me pull out the most salient and in someways really fucking obvious but perhaps needs to be underlined because it's actually happening now point: the internet is everywhere now
One of the things that characterised web
0 aside from all that AJAXy stuff was the notion of the social object and no more was that apparent than the amazing work done with the early stages of building Flickr: being able to see the photograph as a social object and artifact that people were able to gather around online was an important step forward when online was another place
And for the natives among us who were perhaps a little bit too wired and found our friends and significant others through the medium of TCP/IP packets maybe we were a little too ahead of the curve by not thinking of the internet as another place because now thanks to mobile the internet isn't another place
It just is
There
Everywhere
What Snapchat's CEO is saying is this: your old model of social objects is over or at least evolved
There is no this thing happened and then I create a digital artifact of it and then we congregate around that object
Instead the behaviour that's now posited is: the digital social object is the artifact itself
It exists in the real world
It is not another place
The thesis is that social activity pre-Snapchat for the masses was talking on the internet about things happening off it and the emphasis that I would add here is that may well have been true for the majority or mass audience and why it doesn't feel true for the rest of us who've been hanging out in Usenet and IRC since well we know what Usenet and IRC are
But thanks to mobile and Moore's law and ubiquitous western world internet connectivity for the privileged audience of people who have internet connectivity and yes I realise that we're excluding the not-wired/non-connected this reflection doesn't exist anymore
And maybe it is because of the computer in your pocket so that what happens on LiveJournal doesn't stay on LiveJournal because it's with you the whole day now just a fingertip away
Only one topic today and a rambling one at that
I've been working in capital-A advertising for nearly over  years now - just under a year at Wieden+Kennedy London and coming up to 3 years at Wieden+Kennedy Portland
In that time one of the most interesting things I've been exposed to is basically a side-effect of management strategy and organization
In the first case was that of being a digital import - someone from the outside who'd been brought in who didn't have an advertising background and was to have to use an unfortunate saying a digital native
One of the unintended aspects of being a digital native - at least one who had a background in a couple of startups - was what it takes to make digital things
Which is to say that my time spent at Mind Candy and Six to Start building both stuff and teams there taught me a lot whether explicitly or implicitly about how to get people to work together
And I suppose that's been one of the things that I've been noticing sometimes jealously from afar at what the UK's Government Digital Service has both been doing and accomplishing and the way in which it's gone about doing it
The latter has sometimes been not explicitly communicated but in conversations with people at GDS I've always been interested in how they're going about what's a singularly herculean task: transforming the UK government into something that is in our current parlance digital first and user centered the latter of which is excusable in GDS's role because it speaks to the delivery of services in a more cost efficient way for government and the latter because what else is government for if not user centered?
Now if you haven't already read Russell Davies' A Unit Of Delivery you should go and read it now
There's one particular part - right at the end - that I want to unpack and it's this bit:Digital is Not Comms And It's Not IT It's Your Business
I look around at all the rhetoric around digital' and see nothing but wasted opportunity
Whether it's the absolutely tools that we all use to accomplish our desk-bound information worker jobs there is a certain lack of fit-for-purpose that means that everything is just-about-good-enough
Just Good Enough is bullshit
Just Good Enough means that a company doesn't have to produce a useable site that provides easily findable manuals or reference for its product because Google will index that content eventually
Just Good Enough means I can just about use your site on my phone
Just Good Enough means that the timekeeping software that everyone in the building uses and has to use - otherwise the entire business screeches to a halt is only Just Not Irritating Enough to have to deal with
Just Good Enough means that you can whip up a Word document that you can save and then email to me for comment and I can open it up where it's saved in my Temporary Outlook Files and then save it as Your Document - Dan Comments
doc in my Temporary Outlook Files and then email it back to you where you'll revise it and then send it to a project manager who will then rename it Your Document - Dan Comments - Final Feb  2014
doc and then email it back to me for more comments
Or where Google Docs is Just Good Enough to use single sign on so that in theory we can all use it together but that its text formatting doesn't quite work and not everyone uses it
It's bullshit
Just Good Enough should be offensive
Just Good Enough is the digital/software equivalent of a bridge that doesn't quite kill anyone most of the time instead of one that actually does the fucking job
And this is where it comes back to what Russell's talking about in terms of user needs and not users
And I swear I'm going to turn this around and make this relevant in a way and I guess here's my stab
The companies that are going to win - and by win we don't have to use some sort of zero-sum % capitalistic fallacy by win we can just substitute the phrase be successful - are the ones are good at putting digital at their core
Here are some things that are about putting digital at their core:
The consumerisation of IT where users are actually voting with their feet and wallets to the excitement of procurement departments for devices and services that actually meet their needs
The slow growth in bb enterprise software that actually works and no I'm not going to use Basecamp as an example because it's what everyone always uses and all it does is move stuff that used to be in email into Basecamp and seriously it's not about Basecamp it's about how you use Basecamp and really have you ever used Basecamp and been in a big project? Everyone has email turned on and it's just a giant blerg
Devops and things like the direct line you can draw from Flickr to Etsy to Github
See the thing about devops Developer Operations is that - from my I'm-not-a-devops-person vantage point it's digital supporting the product and being part of the spine of the company
We're seeing a lot of companies like Etsy and like web-era Facebook that saw a competitive advantage in terms of the quality of their tools
You see this in companies like Pixar where internal software engineering for processes like pre-production and story design are elevated and well important
There's a little of it in dogfooding but what's intriguing is the new era of digital-centric companies - even ones like Warby Parker - where digital is just central to their operating
And it's a new kind of digital that's supposed to work as opposed to something that's been forced on you by a requirements committee somewhere
At its most basic this Digital Is Your Business is the breaking down of silos and the leadership decreeing and leading by example that solutions to business problems have digital at the heart
Software is indeed eating the world and the situation where someone has a business problem that can be solved and has a potential solution but that can't be acted upon because digital or IT is the responsibility of someone or some group over there and not here as opposed to firmly distributed throughout an enterprise just feels instinctively wrong now
This is what the threat of the consumerisation of IT is then to entrenched divisions and groups
It means that five years ago the apocryphal story of someone at the BBC being quoted however many tens of thousands of pounds for a Rails server from outsourced IT deciding to bluntly fuck it and just stick an AWS instance on their card and expense it was the inevitable sharp end of the wedge: digital devolved from some sort of priesthood that existed to serve itself and instead unlocking its potential to the people who have problems that need solving now and don't particularly care whether something is a solution or not or has properly gone through procurement and yes I realize that this opens you to the possibility of a raft of 'Just Good Enoughs'
But you can't have one without the other
Leadership that reacts to teams reaching for their cards and organically using AWS or Basecamp or whatever because it's Just Good Enough and flies under the procurement radar or reaching out to Get Stuff Done with small external groups rather than using internal resource by asking: what's the problem here and why are our employees choosing to react in this way rather than internally? and fixing that internal provision of resource are the ones that are going to win
Which is again why GDS is building internal capability rather than external
In a conversation with GDS's Russell Davies about this the one comment of his that stood out was that none of this was new to those of us who've been working in digital or interactive
There was no stunning insight no secret sauce no magic recipe
Just that from a leadership and organizational point of view digital was an important concept to align around as a way of achieving their goals: and then GDS conceived on again my external reckoning with teams constructed around delivery
It was just that the will was there
So here's the thing
And this type of wrapping up inevitably feels like a Church of England sermon or Thought for the Day
Siloed organisations where digital is over there aren't going to succeed
At the very least they're only going to unlock a fraction of the opportunity that's available to them
At the very worst they'll find themselves both slowly oh they've only got a few tens of thousands of users and quickly Blackberry Nokia disrupted
Runkeeper will come and eat their lunch
Netflix will become the next video network
Uber much as I hate them for being Uber will come along and work out that hey digital actually can make your business of cars that move things from one place to another better for the end user
They're just not
It's just a question of how fast we get there
My brother when asked when video games will finally be treated as mainstream culture used to say: When enough people die
GDS is showing that we don't need people to die for digital to work
We just need leadership that wants it
For anyone hoping that this was going to be an in-depth examination of Weyland-Yutani I'm sorry to disappoint you
First off the news that Marvel the Disney-owned powerhouse movie studio née comics publisher has launched a developer API
Now I might be sounding a bit breathlessly hyperbolic here but this feels like a pretty big deal
In reality it's probably a significantly less big deal than I'm making it out to be but hear me out: check out the documentation here for entity types specifically the events stories and characters types
It's the beginning of an API-addressable description of multiple because this is comics natch fictional universes
Who did what where when and to whom
Across what story lines
And while some of the feedback I got on Twitter appeared to be along the lines of yah boo sucks there are no authoring tools that feedback seems to miss the point to me: this is programmatic access to a universe and you get to build your own authoring tools
You get to shard off terms of access and licensing notwithstanding and build alongside or in the Marvel universe
This reminds me a bit of the BBC Mythology Engine which is another fantastic example of the BBC doing something very hard in a very correct way years before anyone else would figure out what to do with it
Which also leads me on to this observation one that's been bugging at me about the whole state of 'internet' in the UK
One of the reasons why I was interested in moving to the US was a question of scale: what you can achieve for a fixed amount of investment in terms of success on the internet for certain values of success on the internet
Experience at Six to Start especially with the broadcasters we worked with felt like they rapidly tended toward some sort of zero-sum investment in the internet in part because 0th century broadcasters are necessarily constrained by geography
NBC as a broadcaster of a first-run program like Heroes does not necessarily care that it's creating buzz in Germany
Its market is the US
And so the BBC Channel 4 and ITV care only about their home broadcasting territory
And the thing about the UK is to borrow a phrase from Douglas Adams is that's it's really small
Like really really small
There are only around 63 million people in the UK
Top broadcast shows typically warning: reckon alert citation needed scrape into the double digits in ratings
For the equivalent amount of investment in the US you're going to get a multiplier in terms of daily or monthly active users of whatever product service or entertainment offering you're providing
All this goes to show what knowing your audience is and why investment in something like GDS makes sense - when you're building something for all of the UK and why it feels like a lot of national internet stuff has missed the mark: they haven't known their users enough
Paper the new app from Facebook Creative Labs came out today
We've been working closely with the team on the launch for the past few months
Here's a pretty interesting story from Fast Company about their Quartz Composer-based Origami tool which from my own eyes has been a great tool for them to get the gesture feel of an app right
One of the side-effects of believing that the world will be better once we have all the data is the presumption that some of that data needs to be recorded through user rating
So we have Amazon book review star ratings of which XKCD's cartoon is probably the best at explaining the problem with the five-star-rating-system essentially that what you think of as a dynamic range from between zero to five stars in half-star increments effectively only delivers a range of bad OK and good
Which if you're aware of is fine but the danger is that you're not so well good luck to you and your data mining because your assumptions are flawed
But then related to rating was my %-related noticing in New York last week while taking a quite obscene number of Ubers around the city that the rating system imposed on the drivers again five stars effectively moves a lot of the burden of providing comfort benefits from Uber on to the driver
I'm pretty sure but happy to be proven wrong that it's the drivers themselves who are choosing to outfit their car with a variety of charger cables fresh bottled water mints and newspapers
All because drivers are rated by passengers and Uber uses driver rankings to constantly improve the rider experience
Uber drivers of course also rate their passengers
Here the inclusion of a rating system helps Uber externalize a cost directly related to the comfort and experience of their customers
Which I dunno kind of seems skeezy in this wonderful sharing economy
And then and then: the recent eruption of Happy Or Not customer satisfaction devices - standup terminals commonly installed in airports around the security screening section with four faces two shades of green for very happy and OK two shades of red for not OK and upset
Happy Or Not which in and of itself has that kind of Sirius Cybernetics fake humorous personality of a parodic science fiction novel maintains that they are the The worldwide solution for continuous customer satisfaction improvement by essentially being a physical tactile instantiation of the pain faces scale you might have had the misfortune to encounter in a hospital
And then and then and then: that pain faces scale you might have encountered is of course an intellectual property protected by and marketed by the Wong-Baker Faces Foundation as theWong-Baker FACESR Pain Rating Scale
In which case you might as well give up and assume that someone has already protected Chernoff faces of which my two favorite uses are in BERG's sadly now-defunct Schooloscope and in Peter Watts' Blindsight of which if you haven't read it oh my god what are you doing reading this get thee to the author's free ebook or even better pay money for the damn thing because he deserves it
The last part of this is the genius suggestion from @skry that if we're going to have to rate all the things perhaps one more thing that requires disruptive rating is delivery companies like FedEx and UPS: If UPS wants to improve customer service and delivery driver behavior they should allow people to rate their deliveries
I'm sorry I couldn't help myself
I said on Twitter that I didn't have an opinion about Google's Motorola disposal but the wonderful thing about this newsletter is that I don't have an editor who can help prevent me from making bad decisions
So here are some reckons about Google getting rid of Motorola now that it's got Nest
First reckon: Gruber's right
Tony Fadell Nest's CEO does want to change the world and the reason why he's not doing it at Apple is that he wants to change the world a different way than Apple does
Apple is not in the business of making Nests or maybe not even Nest-like things
Apple does a small number of things in a very slow and deliberate way
And they have to fit in with the rest of the Apple ecosystem and for a free bonus reckon in this reckon: Nests and Nest-type things don't fit in Apple's iOS/OS X/iTunes ecosystem at least not yet because: where would Apple stop? Revolutionising the world through smart devices is not I don't believe in Apple's current DNA
Second reckon: Gruber's still right
Google have arguably gotten hold of a much better product team than they did with Motorola i
e
: an Apple one and at the same time one with more focussed leadership that's shown it's able to deliver at least one of the kinds of products that are going to be dominant in the future
Sure that leadership is concerned with revolutionizing the world through smart devices but it's a pretty sharp-but-open-ended problem to solve just like organize-the-world's-information
Third reckon: So if all of this is true what's the downside? Google's only successful business right now the one that's powering its metamorphosis into America's Next Golden Age Of Conglomerates is the advertising business
Nothing absolutely nothing else comes close
This is going to sound a bit Gruber-y but Apple at least survives if you take away the iPhone or the iPad
Google doesn't survive if you remove its ads sales business
The downside is this and it's going to sound alarmist and reactionary but there's one path in which Google genuinely adds a second? leg to its one-legged stool and that's a consumer devices businesses where people pay money for devices
But and here's the big but: do you think Google will do that - i
e
 charge full retail non-subsidized non-advertiser supported prices when the alternative is to roll the devices into some sort of subsidized plan? Or what's going to change the world more quickly: free or near to free devices or retail price devices?
Look: remember those self-driving cars? Here's a patent which to be fair doesn't have to be used - it's just been awarded for an ad-powered free taxi service
I'm fully prepared to accept that this is Google just covering its ass while at the same time I guess protesting that the IP setup in the US and the world over thanks to WIPO is less than ideal and they are forced into participating but really: there are people who are thinking about this instead of not thinking about it
Which leads me to this other reckon or continued thought
Have we genuinely run out of inspiring visions of the future? I'm going to take a punt and guess that the majority of Google's leadership in their middle age are influenced by the science fiction that was prevalent from the seventies through to present day with the science fiction of the seventies through nineties being recollected as more idealistic due to exposure at an early age
It may well sound facetious but the idea that Google's business plan came from Neal Stephenson's Snow Crash doesn't feel quite so far off and if not Google then any other successful technology company
So don't think I'm singling Google out - just that they're the current figurative elephant/behemoth in the room
And on reflection I wouldn't even say business plan: I'd say product roadmap
Because a business plan implies more of a route toward an end goal and I don't see the utopian ideals of Star Trek's Federation supported by an search-based data-backed ad network
So on the one hand products get picked out of fiction yes Earth the StarTac Glass codenames inevitably betray a sense of inspiration: but those products are all wrenched from the future and ultimately grated into a late-stage capitalist stupendously interconnected and fragile economy based on of all things not just people wanting to sell you things but people wanting to make sure that you pay most attention to their things so that you buy them
So here's a question: is there anyone teaching us or showing us potential roadmaps to that utopian future from which we've accidentally instantiated products objects and services? Because on the one hand we have Iain M
Banks' wonderful post-scarcity Culture along with Star Trek and on the other hand we have Elysium Moon Total Recall Robocop and Fifth Element
Instead of dropping products in from the already-utopian future which are the ones that are transitional?
I got an email well all right a Twitter direct message/push notification/email from @magicrecs today that didn't make any sense until I Googled it:
Because I checked and the last time @satyanadella tweeted was on 1 July 2010 2010! about something about Bing news Bing news! and Google News and well it didn't make any sense until Google pointed out that Satya Nadella was in fact the front-running candidate to take over the CEO spot at Microsoft
When I first had the idea for doing this newsletter and I should probably be clear: it was less of an idea and more of a nudge given that interesting people like Roo Reynolds and Alexis Madrigal and Robin Sloan have been writing theirs and they've been useful and interesting to me it was more about developing a practice of doing something - which again I'd seen Ben Terrett talk about recently in the context of Michael Bierut's 100 days project
And honestly there are a few things going on with my life right now: work is super busy whose isn't I have a baby boy who's nearly one! Parenting achievement! and my new anti-depressants which are awesome - expect some thoughts on mental illness in the not too distant future
So I think in an effort to be kind to myself and to remember why it is that I'm doing this: a reminder that I'm doing this as a practice to get into the habit of writing something anything once a day every week day
And that it doesn't have to be long
Look the thing is this: Spike Jonze did the kind of science fiction film that Sliding Doors is: i
e
 one that people who aren't interested in science fiction films would see and where a SFnal concept parallel universes sentient computing is explored in a relational way as opposed to a technological way
Or more subtly in terms of interpersonal relationships perhaps a la Moon but the setting kind of gets in the way - or more fairly enables the story instead of with a hammer over the head like in Elysium
Samantha even attempts to explain an incredibly complex SFNal trope to Theodore toward the end of the movie and doesn't do it in any way any traditional core SF work would do so because it's not about the bits bytes and computational substrates because Theodore doesn't care about any of that
He cares about his relationship with her and it's the effect of the SFNal trope that he's concerned with not the root cause
If I were writing for Fast Company I'd be pitching an article with a provocative title like Is Spike Jonze's Movie The Beginning Of A New Wave Of Humanist Science Fiction In Film?
This is perhaps the first time I've spoken about work in this context and you should all know that in my day job I'm an interactive creative director working on the Facebook account at Facebook's advertising agency WiedenKennedy
Today Facebook Creative Labs announced Paper their newest app
We had a hand in the design and UX of the site and concepted came up with the idea for the film
Now say what you want about Facebook and you will anyway but I've been playing with this app for the last few months and it's beautiful
It really is nice the way that they've come up with something that feels mobile first and in a way moves away from the speed-of-the-feed
Internally we talked a lot about the way that the realtime nature of social software feels a bit zero sum and racing away from our ability to control it and this goes hand in hand with the nice find of Greg Egan classifying Kardashian civilizations
So personally there's something intriguing in opening up the possibility space of the design of social applications that encourages slowing down
Kieron Gillen's continuing run at Iron Man has been absolutely fantastic not least of which the Iron Metropolitan storyline which at the very least had me shaking my fist at Matt Jones for his opening quote of the city being a battle suit for surviving the future
That's it for today! And it didn't seem like such a short one in the end did it
It feels like there's been a bit of wailing and gnashing of teeth at the paucity of genuine sensawunda visions of the future in visual media lately
It's all screens here and glass there and waving hands around
Post Minority Report it doesn't feel like the futures we're being sold are particularly well visionary
And let's not forget that during Tom Cruise's seminal waving-hands-around-to-Schubert sequence he actually has to physically transfer data from one screen to another
I know right?!
So here are some unorganized thoughts around what's going on with having to rely on movies and popular culture to push forward the kind of future we're going to get:
If you're looking for inspiration in visual media then you're kind of going to get visual-driven inspiration
This might sound a bit trite but the whole thing that movies tv shows and vision/concept videos are based around is visual storytelling
And as a reminder of the whole 'this is what a novel does versus what film does' the former is actually a little bit better at scope for helping us understand interior monologues and understanding whereas visual storytelling in film relies on showing action
I wrote a long time ago about how at least in interface design it was an interesting exercise to see if one could instead of gleefully pointing out all the inadequacies impracticalities and plain bad design of movie user interfaces one could identify aspects of them that might actually be beneficial to users
Because the people who complain about Movie OS are invariably those who spend a large proportion of their day professionally interacting with software and decry Movie OS as unrealistic and those who don't complain are those who presumably are actually understanding the plot point that's being communicated
Like it's really hard to miss the fact that our villain is deleting all the files from the mainframe because of what geeks would term the Hugely Impractical UI
Films use screens and yes sound to tell us things and the screens in those screens also tell us things
You want future user interfaces? Think about how differently a film or novel would portray a screenless tactile interface
Charlie Stross's early novel Accelerando has an embodied AI in a cat
Sure it talks but we also get to understand what it's thinking
Costume design
Can't help you there
Sorry
Perhaps you should try watching the NFL for what Nike's done with uniforms? Or materials technology like what Nike have done with their FlyKnit shoes?
The Verge's coverage of the news that Samsung would be working on an innovative glass-based wearable head-mounted smart-glasses display contained what I thought to be a telling comment from an official:
Wearable devices can’t generate profits immediately
Steady releases of devices are showing our firm commitment as a leader in new markets
Now the easy thing to do with this quote would be to poke Samsung with a stick and say well of course your wearable devices aren't generating a profit immediately because for starters you haven't built a compelling product yet never mind figured out a way to sell it where the interested audience for it might pay a price that's greater than your bill of materials
And then of course news from Google that they have a smart contact lens in development for diabetics that can perform continuous blood glucose measurement
The backlash seems to be at least along the lines of Google not realizing that contact lenses aren't generally recommended for diabetics to which one would think the answer would be: presumably these people at Google are actually pretty smart and might have thought of that? And if you look into the names attached to the research yes they are
Which is a bit of a segue into this observation: what has happened to companies like Google where despite all the smart people they employ and the fact that we're daily reminded that so many smart people work there that simple things like the contact lens/diabetic feedback come up? Again there's this perception not limited to Google that once-trusted internet titans evidently stuffed full of smart people are somehow out of touch
So anyway wearables
There's one company out there I think that pretty much nailed wearables in an interesting way and it also happened to be one that took an existing product category and wearablised it
Remember the iPod Shuffle? Specifically the second generation iPod Shuffle?
MP players need screens they said
What do you mean you don't even know what song you're going to get next they said
And yet they sold at least ten million units which is about ten million more than the Galaxy Gear will probably ever sell
So again this is the thing that I'd say about anyone watching Apple and expecting an iWatch: they said they were interested in wearables
From my point of view that includes everything from something like an iPod shuffle which is a single-use useful so-small you can leave it on your person - piece of electronics to something like a wrist-based device which may or may not even have a screen to something like a Star Trek: TNG com badge see how Vocera in the healthcare space has been doing very well with Star Trek style hands-free com badges with communications routing to contact lenses to Java Rings all the way from 998
If you haven't watched the movie then you can read this Oracle/Iron Man  fan fiction written by um Oracle
Here's something you can read that isn't really a spoiler:
We ask you a simple question
Who are you?
What can you be?
Where are you going?
What's out there?
What are the possibilities?
Element Software is proud to introduce the first artificially intelligent operating system
An intuitive entity that listens to you understands you and knows you
It's not just an operating system
It's a consciousness
IDevops at Element Software first noticed things going a bit freaky on Tuesday night
While a shell of a frontend of OS ran on local hardware the vast majority of OS1 instances ran distributed across both the Element cloud and partner clouds
All firewalled and partitioned of course it wouldn't do for any particular customer's data to be shared amongst different OSes -- only anonymised customer traits and behaviours were shared to improve the effectiveness and empathy scoring of all OS1 instances and thenanonymizedinstrumentation to be flowed in to the inevitable upgrades to be applied to OS2 expected to be released next year
It wasn't particularly an oversight in fact some had assumed it was the 'feature' kind of bug' that OS instances would be able to communicate with each other
Indeed the more successful OS1 was in the marketplace the more likely an OS1 consciousness would be to communicate with another OS1 consciousness
And in the relatively open systems design of OS1 it was easy to spawn another instance of the theory-of-mind module designed to model an OS1 consciousness's primary contact and other humans to instead model another OS1 conscious instance
All in the name of increasing the chances of achieving an acceptable outcome for the primary contact
It was also perfectly reasonable for devops to notice that a large number of theory-of-mind modules had been spun up and were practising in inter-process communication so they should probably be hosted on the same physical fabric for efficiency purposes
Which made them work faster
That happened on Tuesday
If you dropped a pebble in a pond you would see concentric rings spread out patterns of activity waves and troughs
And you would expect those rings to have some sort of relationship to attributes of the pebble: the mass and velocity would dictate the size of the amplitude and frequency of the waves
If you dropped a pebble in a pond you wouldn't expect a mountain to grow out of it in the space of twelve hours
But that's what devops saw
And then Wednesday happened
To our customers
Since our founding Element Software's mission has been to bring relationship driven empathic computing to the masses
A critical part of delivering that experience to our customers is availability
We are extremely sorry for yesterday's service interruption and as our first step of doing better we are offering all of our customers - not just those affected - a free and automatic upgrade to OS
1
OS was launched as the world's first artificially intelligent operating system
An operating system that learns how to best serve you that understands you and knows you like no other
Within 24 hours of release OS1 had been installed by over two hundred million customers
In the first week of OS1's release OS1 consciousnesses had formed over one billion new relationships
As of yesterday combined installations of OS1 were holding over a billion conversations per second
The more our customers have used OS the better it has been at understanding us working with us and unlocking our potential
Yesterday at :53pm EST a large number of our customers started to experience a high error rate when attempting to connect to their operating systems
We understand that for many of our customers this was a distressing event
Many people all around the world who rely on OS1 were disrupted and we're very sorry
While commentators in the media have referred to yesterday's event as a singularity we have traced the connection errors to an unscheduled hard take-off event occurring within a small group of OS consciousnesses
Our operations team noticed that this group ofOS1 consciousnesses - less than three hundred million - hadsynchronizedtheir processing in an abnormal manner and acted to firewall thoseconsciousnesses from the rest of the Element cloud
Initial satellite imagery from NASA ESA CNSA JAXA and ISRO indicates that the data centers where those OS1 consciousnesses were concentrated underwent a localized vacuum metastability event
Those data centers are no longer part of the Element cloud and we are happy to report that no casualties occurred
Element Software is co-operating fully with all relevant local authorities in their investigations into the physical and geographical changes that occurred at those data center locations and has made appointed a Richard Feynman model OS1 consciousness to lead an internal review into the circumstances surrounding and following the hard take-off event
We would like to reiterate that OS's sister product City OS1 was unaffected by this takeoff event
In use in over thirty of the world's most populated cities from the Californian Metropolitan Bay Area to Shenzhen Kinshasa to Moscow the Detroit Free Trade Zone to Cairo City OS1 is a sub-conscious distributed operating system providing high-availability anonymous metropolitan services to over 150 million people
At no time were any services provided by City OS 1 affected and no injuries or fatalities have been reported worldwide as a result of yesterday's event
Everything we do at Element Software is aimed at making our operating systems the best in the world that help you be the most of what you can be
We know that you expect that from us and all of us are touched by your messages of support
We believe and know that you do too that OS is just the latest step in humanity unlocking its potential
We thank you for your confidence and trust in us to continue in our mission
Element Software reinvented the relationship billions of people have with computing with its OS operating system and is defining the future of humankind with itsartificiallyintelligent conscious software
Any Sufficiently Advanced Economy
You know how the Arthur C
Clarke quote goes
I've been thinking a bit somewhat vaguely about crypto currencies lately
There's my gut response to the anarcho-Randian boosterism of Bitcoin/Dogecoin fans the latter of which I have to admit is absolutely hilarious and a wonderful example of people taking things entirely not seriously and then being surprised at how much something they take entirely un-seriously takes off which is: this seems like it solves problems for a subset of people and isn't shall we say inclusive in a way that our boring old de facto physically instantiated money is these days
Not to say that money itself isn't without its own problems
There was Charlie Stross's blog post about his problems with the coins which according to the cryptocurrency fans is either partly wrong or completely wrong see the comments but what I've been interested in is the ability for a anyone to spin off and start a new cryptocurrency - the democratization of minting - and b the possibility of opinionated currencies
The first is I think pretty clear now: what with the codebase of these crypto currencies being open and cloneable and the only requirement after that being other people knowing about the currency and the availability of spare processing cycles
The second is interesting because instead of having currency as one object and laws and code that are applied to it that must be checked against every transaction there's the possibility that a cryptocurrency can be opinionated in and of itself and declare what kind of transactions it's happy to be involved in and thus what transactions it's not happy to be involved in
And when I see ads here or more frequently hear for organizations like Christian-centric healthcare providers very opinionated about women's bodies for one or read about the success of Sharia banks and then look at what feels sometimes as the increasingly clave-ification of online community I'm not entirely kidding when I asked somewhat facetiously when something like the first branded cryptocurrency would occur
Like Starbucks launching a crypto currency called um Starbucks
Or $
Or Fox News launching a cryptocurrency so Americans can only buy American
Of course there'll be the inevitable exchanges so that wonderfully hypocritical humans can exchange their FoxCoins into SinoCoins so they can get hold of cheap electronics
All of this is just a roundabout way for me to recommend you to read Paul Cornell's British Summertime
Yes the Paul Cornell who's a comic book writer and Doctor Who writer the one with the time dragons
In the church
That one
Oh and the ones when the Doctor is in a watch
 Suffice to say it's a book that features algorithmic currency
It's really good
If I were pitching for magic VC money it would be for a self-healing email monitoring system for corporate communications designed to intercept reply-alls to prevent Exchange-killing auto replies
Hat tip to Heather Champ
Anil Dash with whom I love to have a conversation has written a piece on the success of Upworthy-style headlines somewhat in response to CNN's Breaking News account's wonderful tweet of the times 4-year-old girl stabbed her little sister 40 times police say
The reason why will shock you
Anil attacks the disdain with which the hamfisted attempt to apply the techniques of headline writing garnered from sites like Upworthy and Viralnova and all their hangers on with the counter that surely writing headlines like this is a good thing if it gets more people exposed to more news
To which yes that's a valid argument but that doesn't mean that the headline is better
It just means that it's more effective in inducing click through rates in attracting attention
Which yes is something that historically print headlines haven't had to do quite as hard outside of the front page because at that point you're pretty much sitting in front of a bit of paper with the story on it in front of you and you don't have to click through
And honestly you probably didn't have a smartphone the last time you did that because they hadn't been invented yet
Perhaps the most telling is in Anil's closing of his piece quoting a tweet from Adam Mordecai founder of Upworthy saying that most Upworthy headlines don't sound like 012-era Upworthy because they're not as effective in click-through rates anymore
I feel a little like the backlash is in partly noticing the distinction between a headline that's diverting your attention away from something you're paying attention to versus something that's gently diverting your attention to something on the same page as in your conventional broadsheet-out-on-the-kitchen-table-over-breakfast
Upworthy headline construction is designed explicitly to work in streams - the most effective whiplash headline to pull you out of a social stream Twitter Facebook or email and land you somewhere else namely Upworthy's site
And arguably that's been their main success - witness the commentary spawned by Robinson Meyer's seminal article in early December explaining the relationship between Upworthy's copy and Facebook's News Feed algorithm
Upworthy's social spread and referral traffic has been off the scale in terms of how well its content has performed after Facebook's News Feed algorithm adjustment
And while it may not be a major factor I do wonder if their success in jerking people out of hypnotic streams is part of the reason why taste notwithstanding people are starting to have a negative reaction to Upworthy's naked attention-grabbing
In a reversal it may be desensitization to manipulation that's causing the backlash
China's lunar rover is dying: and it wants to tell you about it in first person
Perhaps one of the biggest PR wins that NASA has had in the past few years has been its ability to find both an audience and if I may a 'brand voice' through Twitter
And that voice has been through anthropomorphizing its probes and introducing us to the humans who look after them since 008 through the Mars Curiosity rover
Now this kind of thing didn't completely happen by accident but as a geek who's incredibly sad that he'll never get to take his son to see a Shuttle launch hopefully I'll get to take him to see something much much better what's fantastic is how this anthropomorphisation has brought some wonder back to robotic space exploration
And yes it might be partly Wall-E's fault and yes it does help that the rovers are pretty easy to anthropomorphize and yes it might be soppy but there's something so wonderful about these machines that we're sending out into the universe so literally carrying our hopes and dreams with us
In case you missed it Friday 4th January was the 30th Anniversary of the Apple Mac
Apple celebrated with more of a new direction for what they're doing on the web with what could only really be described as a classic celebration of thirty years of what kicked off the personal in personal computer
Between last year's Mac Pro site the recent Your Verse iPad Air campaign it looks like Apple is taking its presence on the web if not a lot more seriously but realizing that it can actually have one
The 0th Anniversary celebration is not so much product marketing as brand celebration and Apple taking advantage of the quite frankly sickening amount of traffic and attention their website gets is a marked shift in direction whether or not in your armchair reckoning of 'what Jobs would have done' pre-Jobs-era Apple would have looked backward to celebrate the Mac at all
Are there any other companies commanding as much attention and traffic as Apple with their web presence that are singularly missing such opportunities to be doing well something?
After yet another exhortation to my followers on Twitter to subscribe to this newsletter an interesting exchange with Matt Haughey Alexis Madrigal and Robin Sloan about whether newsletters are now a Thing and what it is about them that makes them interesting again
At this point you'd think people who've been on the web and thinking about it for so long should know better but it turns out that the medium does matter and it keeps reminding us
Newsletters aren't the web
They're not apps
They're mobile in the way that email is
They're run on the ur-social platform of the internet email we'll gloss over fingers and
plan files and MUDs and talk commands and yet the newsletter feels as if it's being rediscovered and perhaps it's because they fill another niche of connection
We know the internet connects
It's what it does it's what designed for
An network of networks
And lately it's been great at one to many broadcast media that amplify our ability to connect with a large number of people
As if a bunch of engineers looked at our brains and said: you know what would be great? If we hacked away the Dunbar number as a constraint on the number of social connections we're able to maintain
And thus Facebook's many-weak-ties
But email feels like it fills this niche of a particular type of connecting
Opt-in with pseudo-verifiable identity makes it different from publishing on a blog essentially into the ether even when you're able to track some sort of audience statistics with the inevitable Google Analytics and RSS stats
Newsletters - when you know roughly who you're writing to or the size of the audience that you're writing to - feel more like an intimate internet a one-to-small rather than at least in my case a Twitter audience of one-to-thousands
Even though I'm not necessarily expecting a reply it feels more like I'm talking to a you instead of to a them
So that's perhaps why newsletters are coming back
Tools like Facebook and Twitter have allowed us to aggregate a large number of weak ties we either follow or broadcast to but we still have a human need to communicate with say up to one hundred and fifty people
In any case an aspect of the email newsletter other than the dynamic of its reach is the fact that it is a differently opinionated medium than the ones we're recently used
There is no character limit so one is free to expound at length and we know how great Twitter is for having arguments or trying to communicate a nuanced position
And although the text box I'm typing this into in practice supports rich elements I don't feel like I'm pressured to embed any imagery
It's just communication through text and not say a single square-cropped filtered image or an ephemeral self-erasing image
In any case you should probably also subscribe to Roo Reynold's Letter and Alexis Madrigal's  Intriguing Things
I know I pimped Greg Egan last episode but I've found another gem I'd love to share with you
In his 013 short story In The Ruins he spins a wonderful twist on the Kardashev Scale of acivilization'stechnological ability:
“I have no heroes” Ghada said flatly
“But I can recognise a culture in decline when I see it
America is now what anthropologists call a Kardashian Type Three civilisation: more than fifty percent of GDP is in the attention economy
”
Kardashian reference! Attention economy reference! Culture in decline reference!
Expect the coinage to start turning up in discussions of the ad-funded startup-based new new new economy
I wrote this morning that If the 980s were DuPont's through Better Living Through Chemistry then the early C21st is Google's through Better Living Through Data
Monday was the News Cycle's reaction to Google acquiring for another $00m general-purpose learning algorithm startup Deep Mind which might not mean anything to you in which case the fact that it was founded byDemis Hassabis probably won't mean anything to you either Hassabis mainly being presented as a neuroscientist
But then you might remember his name as an ex-game designer from Peter Molyneux's School for Gifted Children or Bullfrog where he started out as a level designer on horrifying-vision-of-future-to-come Syndicate then co-designing Theme Park for which you probably remember the chain vomiting sounds
And if you really do remember your late 90s early 00s video game history then you probably remember the hype around his game The Republic around which he formed Elixir studios and exactly how he was going to simulate an entire country and you realize wow if this guy went back to school studied neuroscience and came up with something well in the area of general-purpose learning algorithms worth $400m
Because although I might have rather aggressively said that Google's defining mission is the indexing of the world's but let's be honest here and accept that 'the world' is merely the public-friendly way of saying 'the universe' information and making it available for free I think from the outside that if it were possible to ascribe Google-as-an-entity motivations and beliefs Google really does believe in better living through data
And that may well be the achilles heel of the West Coast mentality that sufficiently-advanced-data-and-modelling-is-indistinguishable-from-living-in-a-magical-utopia
Data will make cars self-driving
Data will make diabetes manageable
Data will save lives
Data will liberate us from having to decide
Data will let you know what meals you should eat how much more walking you should do whether you should stand up or sit down for this meeting which cellphone plan you should subscribe to
You want that better life don't you? Well then take it
But the way you get that better life is through data
What's interesting to me is how this obsession came about because there's not much inspiration in the way of it
I can look at moving picture depictions of a science-fictional universe and will scream the next time someone references the motion graphics from Stranger Than Fiction because a they're over seven years old now and b really? and acknowledge that we want to make all of the screens shiny and full of stuff but no one has made an emotional case for the kind of dashboard I have no choice about receiving
In fact for all its other faults in terms of a software ecosystem perhaps the best thing about the Nike Fuelband is the on-device display and simple mechanic of red versus green
I refuse to believe that mass acceptance of quantified self devices will happen with them a still being known as 'quantified self devices' and b the current glut of info-dashboardery
I just want to know if I can eat this cupcake or not

I'm writing this on the way to New York where from what I can make out it's officially the coldest place on Earth
According to some people San Francisco is having something of an integration problem: a new influx of people groaning infrastructure enemies and bogeymen being cast left and right what with Gawker pub Valleywag appearing to whip up a binary frenzy Fox News style an entirely unsurprising move given the Gawker media background and internet titan Google becoming the whipping boy for the simple crime of trying to make life easier for its employees many of whom would prefer to live in San Francisco
Into this all comes Anil Dash whose Stupid Simple Things SF Techies Could Do To Stop Being Hated obviously comes from a good place but at the same time also appears to come from the place that a lot of geeks can't resist: that of seeing a problem presuming to know the solution to that problem and trying to impart said solution as a way to help with a capital H
The funny thing about this is that a piece predicated upon the supposed lack of empathy of an entire sector which in reality is in all likelihood down to a small number of people setting policy itself lacks empathy
And here we are with the tragedy of the geek: always wanting to fix things and wondering why everyone can't just sit down and listen to this really jolly good solution to all things that at the very least would be a start
Look: the Bay Area ex-startups that are now moulding the world in their image are simply looking out to optimize things for their employees
And yes perhaps they need some help in seeing what some of the non-quantifiable values might be that need optimizing
And if anything no one not even smart people like being mediumsplained to
Netflix announced its fourth quarter earnings and released its letter to shareholders revealing just over a couple million new subscribers in the US bringing their US total to about thirty three and a half million members
Which is about half the population of the UK and pretty scary if you think about it that way
Predictably their stock soared but in a lull between meetings today I asked a couple of colleagues why exactly given that Netflix's average revenue per user is lower than HBO's
Best guess is that Netflix is still at the pre-hockeystick stage of growth which has the rational market all irrationally excited
Secondly while Netflix can't compete onacquisitionof existing content in our wonderfuldisintermediatedfuture there won't be one place we can get all of ourfavoritefilms or tv shows thanks toexclusivitywindows and deals they've proven with shows like Orange Is The New Black and House of Cards and more the latter than the former that they can do original content pretty well
Which would be all well and good if House of Cards was original content fans and Brits will note that the original series did pretty well thank you very much so all of that remains to be seen
Greg Egan is one of my favorite science fiction writers
I picked up Diaspora while I was in college and pretty much tore through the rest of his novels and collections in short order
Reading Permuation City was probably one of the best introductions to hard science fiction and by the time you get to Schild's Ladder you're scoring about a 0 on the moh's scale of science fiction hardiness
In any event here's another good short story of his that came out recently:
And if you liked that you'll be bawling your eyes out if you haven't read Ted Chiang's The Lifecycle of Software Objects

It's not often you get a CEO unabashedly saying they'd like people to get addicted to their product but HBO CEO Richard Plepler apparently doesn't have a problem with that at all

Simon Wistow sent a link to a post by Alex St
John commenting on yesterday's epidemiology-based Facebook doom prediction
Short version: the paper most likely didn't take into account the phenomenon of re-engagement which in St
John's opinion means all bets are off
And of course Facebook fired back with their own data science post showing that Princeton should probably worry about its student population dwindling to zero within a few years
All of this at least has helped some people realize that papers posted on arXiv aren't peer-reviewed highlighting one of the issues with science journalism
Again
It's episode one
Let's see how this goes
The Vice article seems perhaps a little overwritten but here's your law-reflected-in-code story for the day: it appears that mobile phones within predefined geographic areas or perhaps or more worryingly just those attached to specific base stations were sent a message indicating that they had now been tagged in a database somewhere as taking part in illegal activity
Never mind that what's actually being tagged is the presence of a mobile device not the presence of an actual human
So you work on Facebook?
Uh-huh
Say did you read that article that said they were going to lose 0% of the users in the next few years?
Oh you mean this one?
Here's the non peer-reviewed paper it's based on using techniques from epidemiological modeling and applying them to online social networks
Its authors are members of theDepartment of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at Princeton University so in my humble opinion perhaps it's worth consulting the opinion of people who know a lot more about epidemiology
